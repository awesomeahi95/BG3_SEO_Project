    "- This step involves preparing the raw scraped data for analysis by addressing potential inconsistencies and ensuring uniformity. The key processes include:\n",
    "    - Removing HTML Tags: Extract meaningful textual content from the HTML structure of the guides.\n",
    "    - Cleaning Content: Remove extra whitespace, newline characters, and irrelevant artifacts for cleaner data.\n",
    "    - Tokenization and Preprocessing: Split text into individual tokens (words) and standardize by converting to lowercase, removing stopwords, and eliminating punctuation.\n",
    "    - Checking for Null and Duplicate Values: Identify and address any missing or duplicate entries in the dataset.\n",
