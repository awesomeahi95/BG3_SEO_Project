These consequences and repercussions are no different when it comes to your potential companions as well. In this guide, we'll cover where you can find and recruit Karlach and what decisions will influence her fate in BG3. Looking for something in particular? Click the links below to jump to...  The fiery Karlach will always be found in one place, which is near the Risen Road, which is in the northern part of the map at X:110, Y:499.  If you've already recruited Wyll, his Companion Quest will lead you right to her. You can also speak to Anders, a nearby Paladin of Tyr who will offer you his sword if you kill Karlach for him. This quest will also lead you right to Karlach. The dialogue here will change depending on who you've spoken to thus far, but the gist of the conversation will remain the same. Tell her you're willing to team up with her and she'll join your party.  To put it plainly, there is zero reason to side with Anders over Karlach. Unless you're trying to roleplay someone who's incredibly gullible, there are multiple opportunities to discover Anders is lying to you about who he says he is. Karlach will explain that he and his other men are all agents of Zariel, the same god who damned Karlach. If it's the sword you're interested in, you can pick it up from Anders after you kill him with Karlach.  If you're worried about Wyll departing from your team if you decide to side with Karlach, then worry not. Wyll will eventually see the reason behind your words when you convince him that Karlach is no demon. However, siding with Karlach may carry some other repercussions for Wyll when you next return to camp to rest. Alternatively, if you decide to kill Karlach, it should be obvious that you'll lose the opportunity to recruit Karlach and instead Wyll will be rewarded for his actions later that night. The bottom line is, you can recruit both Wyll and Karlach without issue.  Karlach is very passionate about the lives of her fellow people. If you decide to raid the grove, Karlach will leave your party immediately. She will also not join your party if you've done this before recruiting her.  Alternatively, if you allow the Tieflings to die on the road due to having been evacuated forcefully from the Grove before resolving the issue or you steal the Druid idol and cause the two parties to kill each other, Karlach will also not join your party. Karlach is a character whose fate lies very much in your hands. However, should you decide to side with her and make sure she's able to escape from her old masters and those hunting her, you'll find she's an invaluable asset to the team, providing powerful frontline and strong melee capabilities as a powerful Barbarian.

Have you ever wanted to romance another Companion, but you've (unfortunately) already committed your heart to one? Or maybe you simply didn't want to commit (sorry, Gale!) but were left wondering if there would be any adverse side effects to your travel party? We can confirm that you're able to begin a romance with multiple Origin Characters, but once you commit to one (seeing a sex scene with one of them) there may be some characters that are not too happy with this decision. This is not the same for all characters, but some are strictly monogamous. However, there are alternate romance options that exist within Baldur's Gate 3 that you can romance alongside your main romantic interest, so long as your main Origin Character interest is okay with it.  The most important thing you can do for each romance is talk to your romantic interest in camp often! Learn about them and see more of their story, it can also be an easy way to gain approval with them and even advance a romance scene if you missed their scene in Act 1.

https://www.polygon.com/24035856/karlach-bg3-romance-guide-baldurs-gate-3,Baldur’s Gate 3: How to get Karlach as fast as possible | Polygon,"One easy trick to get a head start on Karlach’s romance in Baldur’s Gate 3, starting in Act 1 at the Druid Grove.","['All my friends are strategically jumping off a cliff for a Baldur’s Gate romance and you can too', 'Is this really necessary?', 'So, let’s get started', 'Step 1a: Start the game and assemble a party', 'Step 1b: Find Gale', 'Step 2: Get inside the Druid Grove', 'Step 3: Get to the cliff', 'Step 4: Screw your courage to the sticking place', 'Step 5: God save my little broken body', 'Most Popular', 'Patch Notes', 'This is the title for the native ad', ""More in Baldur's Gate"", 'This is the title for the native ad', 'The Latest ⚡️']","One stupid trick to get a head start on Karlach’s story by  Susana Polo My friends have found it so difficult to date Karlach Cliffgate in Baldur’s Gate 3 that we’ve developed a workaround technique in which our characters leap off a sheer cliff face, sustaining nearly lethal damage, in order to meet her faster. Is this is extremely stupid? Yes. Are we probably being overcautious? Yes. But you don’t know what I’ve been through. The hours I spent replaying the early areas of BG3, trying to get this absolutely charming tiefling Barbarian to like me, without success. You don’t know how I’ve suffered. You see, unlike some of your other companions in Baldur’s Gate 3, if you don’t get Karlach to like your player character by the middle of Act 1, you will not have another chance to trigger her romance subplot. And, unique among your companions, she is also tucked in an out-of-the way corner of the map that’s gated by some really tough battles. I’m not the only person I know who reached the point of no return much earlier and less successfully than anticipated, and even after devoting weeks to immediately replaying the whole starting arc of the game came away with nothing to show for it. I wish better for you, reader. And so I’m sharing the extremely stupid trick my friends developed for a Karlach romance playthrough: the Karlach Cliffstrat. [Ed. note: This piece contains mild spoilers for the first act of Baldur’s Gate 3.] Before you leap to the comments (perhaps taking fall damage) to tell me this isn’t necessary: You’re probably right! Larian Studios has made many tweaks to the game since this summer, when me and my friends were pining over Karlach’s pixelated indifference and settling for our second-choice romance. Those tweaks have probably improved things in invisible ways. But when I start my next Karlach-focused playthrough, I won’t be taking any chances. I will not slash, blast, and charisma-check my way through hours and hours of the beginning of Baldur’s Gate 3 only to face the choice of immediately replaying it. I can’t do that again. “It’s difficult to summarize the hardship that is watching a loved one get locked out of a video game romance,” Becky Chambers, award-winning author and inventor of the Karlach Cliffstrat, told me via direct message. She developed the Cliffstrat after observing her wife’s difficulty in activating Karlach’s romance. “I’m on my computer smooching Shadowheart every time I walk into camp,” Chambers said, “and she’s on her computer saying, ‘it’s okay, she’s just not into me, I understand.’ She played the entirety of BG3 without getting even one kiss. Unacceptable, even in this economy. It became my mission to remedy this situation, and achieving victory in this is perhaps the high point of my winter. I guess Christmas was also nice.” In short, this strategy is for those who are truly determined. Put simply, the Karlach Cliffstrat takes advantage of a quirk of Baldur’s Gate 3’s map, which allows you to jump from a high cliff in the back of the Druid Grove directly to the valley stream where Karlach is stationed. This bypasses a long walk with several encounters and at least one really tough fight. Just getting to the Grove is a cakewalk in comparison — the hard part is surviving the landing. This makes the Cliffstrat a little easier for player characters who start with a higher hit point total, since, I cannot stress enough, the easiest way to get to Karlach ASAP involves taking a significant amount of fall damage. But if you want to play a tissue-paper-fleshed caster class, the Karlach Cliffstrat will still work — you’ll just have to take some safety precautions. You can go ahead and play through the beginning of the game as you like, until you find yourself alone on a beach with a wrecked ship. From this point, you will soon encounter the majority of your companions, and you should go find them swiftly. The priority right now is to get access to the Druid Grove, and having a full party of four will make that easier. If you’re playing a character with less than, ohhhh, 30 hit points, make a beeline to roughly 222,323 in the map coordinates and pick up Gale. You will easily get to level 2 before taking your leap of faith, and as a wizard, he can learn Feather Fall at level 2. This spell will keep you from taking any fall damage at all while yeeting yourself employing the Karlach Cliffstrat. Just remember to pick Feather Fall when you level him up, then open his spell book to make sure he memorizes Feather Fall on his next long rest, and then take a long rest. There are other ways to get around this damage, of course — potions, class abilities, your own spells, potentially — but Gale’s Feather Fall is universal, replicable, and quick. You could potentially pick a higher hit point character in your party, like Lae’zel, to do the jump. But do you really want Lae’zel, not you, to get that pivotal moment of recruiting Karlach? You’re not getting Lae’zel to smooch Karlach, are you? Well, unless you’re playing as Lae’zel. But I digress. Once you have a full party, you can march directly to the Druid Grove, located at roughly 207,423. Following a series of events, you will hopefully be allowed inside. Ignore all those juicy NPC interactions for now and proceed due north, then take a left at the vendor, and just before you hit a makeshift bar/forge area you’ll see a big door covered in runes. That’s the door to Karlach. Proceed through the door and you’ll be in the “Secluded Chamber.” Again, you can ignore all the NPCs in here and go straight for the ladder in the back, which will bring you back outside again. Walk northwest to the back of that small area and climb the rock face there to a cliff. THE CLIFF. THE CLIFF OF THE KARLACH CLIFFSTRAT. From here, depending on your draw distance settings, you may even be able to see Karlach. Even if not, rest assured, the patch of blood on the other side of that fallen log is where she will be stationed. Your landing zone is just north of the log, and if you select the Jump ability, the game will helpfully display exactly how much damage you’ll take when you hit the ground — a range of about 25 to 35 damage depending on your starting point and jump distance. At this point you may be feeling pretty silly about this whole thing. Chambers admits she felt so in the moment she noticed that she could see Karlach from this weird little bit of the map on the back of the Grove. “I first discounted the idea as absurd. I stood there, on the edge of the cliff, and I thought, ‘no, this is ridiculous, there must be a better way.’ But that sort of narrow thinking is exactly the sort of kneejerk that impedes any sort of personal or societal progress. We didn’t put a man on the moon with that attitude. And so, in a moment of pure quixotic joy, I challenged myself to do the impossible. Quite literally, I took a leap of faith.” Reader, take your own leap. Cast Feather Fall or take any other precautionary methods you have prepared, quicksave, and do the impossible. You did it! Pop your Second Wind or a couple healing potions if you need to. From here you should be able to walk about 10 steps over the log bridge and trigger Karlach’s introductory conversation. Then you can simply fast travel out of the valley, go to camp, put her into your party, and start wooing her in earnest. Using the Cliffstrat, Chambers and her wife were able to successfully trigger Karlach’s romance subplot in their joint multiplayer playthrough. “Marriage is all about overcoming obstacles together,” Chambers said, “and I’m proud of us for seeing this one through. In hindsight, though, I could have used Feather Fall.” Ah, the things we do for love, virtual or otherwise. The best of Polygon in your inbox, every Friday. © 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

https://www.polygon.com/baldurs-gate-3-guides/23817654/best-class-choose-classes,How to choose the best class for you in BG3 | Polygon,Baldur’s Gate 3 makes it hard to find the best class with 12 classes — and 46 subclasses total — to choose from. Here’s how to pick the best class for you.,"['How to choose the best class for you in Baldur’s Gate 3', 'Table of Contents', 'All BG3 classes are ‘good’', 'BG3 classes have strengths outside of combat', 'Should you play a custom or an Origin character in BG3?', 'Which BG3 class (and subclass) is best for you?', 'Best melee class for beginners: Fighter', 'Best ranged class for beginners: Ranger', 'Best class for damage: Barbarian', 'Best class for magic: Druid', 'Best class for stealth: Rogue', 'Best class for melee and magic: Paladin', 'Best class for speed: Monk', 'Best magic class for beginners: Warlock', 'Best healer class: Cleric', 'Best support class: Bard', 'Best class for magic damage: Wizard', 'Best class for social interactions: Sorcerer', 'Most Popular', 'Patch Notes', 'This is the title for the native ad', ""More in Baldur's Gate 3 guides"", 'This is the title for the native ad', 'The Latest ⚡️']","BG3 features a dozen different, equally awesome classes by  Jeffrey Parkin Picking the best class in Baldurs Gate 3 is one of the most important decisions you’ll make in the game — and you have to do it right at the start, with minimal context to work off. Your class mostly determines how your character will fight in Baldur’s Gate, but with 12 classes — and 46 subclasses total across them all — it’s not really an easy decision. Here’s what to know about finding the best class (and the best subclass) for you in Baldur’s Gate 3. The classes in Baldur’s Gate 3 — and in pen-and-paper D&D, for that matter — are all fairly well-balanced. There’s no single best class (barrelmancer aside) in Baldur’s Gate 3, and the game gives you as many opportunities for creative problem solving as it does for punching. Finding the best class really just boils down to how you want to play. Even when playing solo, you’ll still manage the rest of your party, so you’ll get to experiment with multiple classes at once. Your character’s class is mostly about combat, but the underlying Ability Score that it relies on affects the other skills you’ll use to interact with the world. Baldur’s Gate 3 assigns your Ability Scores automatically (though you can tweak it in the character creator), so each class’s primary ability will be your highest score. Bards and Sorcerers are both Charisma-based classes, for example. Their high Charisma will also make them good at skills like Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation. Out of combat, those classes will be better at talking their way out of (and into) trouble and lying. Wisdom-based classes like Clerics or Druids will be more insightful and perceptive of their surroundings. Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you the option to play as an Origin character, meaning you can just choose one of the NPCs from your party and play as them right out of the gate. It’s a perfectly fine way to play if you really don’t want to go through the process of picking out a race and background for your character. That said, you’ll also be limited to that character’s predetermined story. It’s a bit more work at the beginning, but you’ll have a lot more freedom to experience the entire story of Baldur’s Gate 3 if you make a custom character. With all that in mind... Distinctions like caster vs. puncher or melee vs. ranged don’t really work for Baldur’s Gate 3 (or D&D). There’s a lot of overlap in the classes — especially as you level up. And that means there’s no easy way to say one class is best (or even better). Instead, focus on what you want to do (or how you want to do it), and go from there. We’ll list them all below ranked (subjectively) by how difficult they are to play. We’ve put the caster classes toward the more difficult end simply because they’ve got more to manage with their spells and spell slots — punching things is easier than memorizing spells. Nothing against Fighters here, but they’re the easiest class to wrap your head around. You’re not going to need to manage spells or Ki Points. Instead, you’ll see a baddie and then you’ll stab said baddie. Fighters start out as a very straightforward melee class. With high strength, they get all armors and shields, and choose a method of combat to focus on (and get buffs to). They also get a way to heal themselves and way to get a second attack once per short rest. At level 3, you get to choose a subclass from Battle Master, Eldritch Knight, and Champion. Battlemasters get a set of Superiority Dice that let you perform Maneuvers to control the flow of battle and the battlefield. Eldritch Knights add magic into the Fighter’s arsenal. Champions keep it simple with a better change to deal a Critical Hit (for double damage). Champion is the best subclass for a Fighter. Consult our Fighter build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Rangers are agile hunters that focus on Dexterity as their primary Ability. Rangers are an interesting mix of melee, stealth, skills, and magic. That also makes it harder to get the most out of the class. Rangers get Light and Medium Armors and some of the more basic weapons. Rangers also make a lot of choices during character creation (and leveling up) that determine how they play. At level 1, you’ll choose a Favored Enemy — a preferred quarry — and a preferred environment that grants you some magical spells. At level 3, you get to choose a Ranger subclass from Beast Master, Gloom Stalker, or Hunter. Beast Masters get a Companion animal that fights along side you, Gloom Stalkers focus on stealth, and Hunters get to specialize their melee abilities. Hunter is the best subclass for a Ranger. Consult our Ranger build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Barbarians are all about combat. They get light and medium armor (and shields), but they’ve also got the option to keep their AC up even without wearing armor. For weapons, Barbarians get a wide range of heavy hitters like battleaxes and warhammers. Every Barbarian gets the Rage ability that lets them hit even harder and reduce damage during combat (and only during combat). When you hit level 3, you get to choose from the Wildheart, Berserker, or Wild Magic subclasses. Wildheart lets you modify your Rage ability with animal-themed tweaks like healing, jumping, or a stampede. Berserker is a lot more straightforward and focuses on hitting (extra) things and throwing. And Wild Magic adds a magical flair to your Rage with a random magical effect and improved saving throws against magic for you and your allies. Berserker is the best subclass for a Barbarian. Consult our Barbarian build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Druids are the nature-based casters of Baldur’s Gate 3. Most of their magic is nature- or animal-themed and they get Skills to match. What they lack in armor proficiencies — they only get Light and Medium Armor — they make up for with the ability to shapeshift into a badger, wolf, spider, or cat. At level 3, Druids pick from the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, and Circle of Spores subclasses. Circle of Land gets you some extra magic and the ability to cast more spells throughout the day, Circle of the Moon adds a bear to the repertoire of animal shapes you can shift into, and Circle of Spores adds in some extra fungus- and decay-based magic. Circle of the Moon is the best subclass for a Druid. Consult our Druid build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Rogues are Dexterity-based, sneaky fighters. They only get Light Armor, so they have to focus on staying unseen and quick. Their weapons tend to be simple and focus on ones that have the Finesse type — meaning you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength. All Rogues get to use Dash (double movement), Disengage (don’t provoke Opportunity Attacks), and Hide as Bonus Actions. They also get Sneak Attack combat actions that let them deal extra damage whenever they have Advantage. Level 3 Rogues choose from the Thief, Arcane Trickster, and Assassin subclasses. Thief Rogues get an extra bonus action, Arcane Tricksters mix in magic, and Assassins get advantages over surprised or unprepared enemies. Thief is the best subclass for a Rogue. Consult our Rogue build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Paladins start out mixing in (Divine) magic with their melee abilities. They’re the most magic-focused of the melee classes. They get all armors and shields, along with a good mix of weapons. Choosing from the three subclasses — Oath of the Ancients, Oath of Devotion, and Oath of Vengeance — determines what kind of magic you get. Oath of the Ancients adds in healing magic, Oath of Devotion gets defense-focused magic, and Oath of Vengeance adds offensive magic. Paladins also get a handful of other spells for dealing out even more holy justice. Oath of the Ancients is the best subclass for a Paladin. Consult our Paladin build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Monks are a melee class kind of like Fighters, but with a lot more pizzazz. Their best Ability is Dexterity, so their combat is more martial arts than swordplay. Monks don’t get armor and only have a limited set of weapons available, but they make up for it with Unarmed Strikes that deal extra damage. Monks take a little more finesse to play than Fighters. Monk subclasses unlock at level 3 and include Way of the Four Elements, Way of the Open Hand, and Way of Shadow. Way of the Four Elements mixes in spells with your Monk abilities (and uses renamed spells from the caster classes). Way of the Open Hand expands your attacks to include things like knocking down enemies or pushing them with extra melee attacks. And Way of Shadow makes your Monk sneaky and stealthy (think of it as a ninja subclass). Way of the Open Palm is the best subclass for a Monk. Consult our Monk build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Warlocks are casters that made a deal with a higher power for their magic. They play a lot like Sorcerers, but with a slight emphasis on more academic Skills and fewer spells. Warlocks get Light Armor, so they’re a little less squishy than Sorcerers. Like Sorcerers, you’ll pick your Warlock subclass during character creation. You’ll choose from The Fiend, The Great Old One, and The Archfey subclasses that are all themed around where your magic comes from — and determine some of the spells you can use. The Fiend Warlocks get their magic from a demon-like fiend and have hell-themed spells, the Great Old One is more Lovecraftian horror-themed, and the Archfey draws power from a powerful Fey being. Great Old One is the best subclass for a Sorcerer. Consult our Sorcerer build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Clerics are the other side of the Paladin’s mix of magic and melee. They’re not quite as frontline in combat with only Light and Medium armors, but they get more (and more powerful) spells. Clerics also get an extra boost with Channel Divinity that gets them an extra (Divine) magic ability like Turning Undead to drive away zombies or Guided Strike that gives a +10 to Attack Rolls. When you make a Cleric, you choose a subclass (Domain) from a list of seven: Life, Light, Trickery, Knowledge, Nature, Tempest, and War. Each Domain has different spells, actions, and even proficiencies associated with hit. Broadly, Life Domain focuses on healing, Light emphasizes Radiant and Fire magic (in and out of combat), Trickery is good for sneaking, Knowledge gets extra Skills out of combat and brain-based spells, Nature is flavored a little more like a Druid, Tempest is a little more combat and Thunder damage-focused, and War is all about combat. Light Domain is the best subclass for a Cleric. Consult our Cleric build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Bards are a specialized kind of caster class that focus more on performance and charm than a weighty list of spells. Bards only get Light Armor and focus on Charisma as their primary stat, so they rarely belong on the front line of a fight. Where Bards come into their own, though, is with Bardic Inspiration — a way to boost the rolls of their allies — and their spells that are a nice mix of utility and offensive magic. Bards get three subclasses at level 3: College of Lore, College of Valor, and College of Swords. College of Lore Bards get a lot of useful skills to use outside of combat and get to use their Bardic Inspiration to make enemies weaker, College of Valor Bards help their allies hit even harder, and College of Swords Bards focus on a swashbuckling style of combat. College of Valor is the best subclass for a Bard. Consult our Bard build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Wizards are the archetypical caster class. They are the only Intelligence-based class in Baldur’s Gate 3 and have the most spells — and the most spell slots to cast them — of all of the casters. Wizards don’t get any armor and are limited to just daggers and quarterstaffs (quarterstaves?) in combat, so they’re going to rely on magic to do any damage. Your Wizard subclass is chosen when you create the character. You’ll choose from eight schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. Each subclass gets an extra ability themed to the school of magic. Broadly speaking, Abjuration is about protection and defense, Conjuration is about creating something from nothing, Divination gets to foresee (and change) rolls, Enchantment is about charming and controlling minds, Evocation shapes and controls spells, Illusion is about trickery, Necromancy controls life and death, and Transmutation focuses on alchemy and changing the world around you. Evocation is the best subclass for a Wizard. Consult our Wizard build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Sorcerers get their magic from within themselves. Sorcerers are the most flexible and varied in the spells they can use. Their primary Ability is Charisma, so they’re also good at dialogue-heavy encounters out of combat. Sorcerers don’t get any armor, so you’ll have to keep them out of melee combat most of the time. You’ll pick your Sorcerer subclass when you create your character from the Wild Magic, Draconic Bloodline, and Storm Sorcery subclasses. Wild Magic leans into the chaotic and untamed nature of magic, Draconic Bloodline gives a dragon-based flavor to your magic, and Storm Sorcery lets you Fly whenever you cast a spell. Draconic Bloodline is the best subclass for a Sorcerer. Consult our Sorcerer build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. For more information on the classes in Baldur’s Gate 3, consult our overviews on the Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard classes.

We’ll start with the various ways inside the Overgrown Ruins, and then walk you through exploring both areas of the ruins, the Bedchamber and the Dank Crypt, to meet the Hooded Figure and complete the quest. We’ll also point out any important items or secrets you’ll find along the way. North-northeast of the Ravaged Beach where you wake up, you’ll find your first (possible) companion, Shadowheart. She’ll be trying to get into a location called the Overgrown Ruins but can’t get through the locked door. This will add the “Explore the ruins” objective to the “Investigate the ruins” quest to your Journal. There are four ways into the Overgrown Ruins, and whatever path you take will add “Investigate the ruins” to your Journal. Regardless of how you get in, you’ll have to fight a party of adventurers inside (and maybe a few outside). Ancient Door It is (hypothetically) possible to lockpick the Ancient Door where you met Shadowheart. This is probably the hardest (worst) way to approach the Overgrown Ruins. The lockpicking difficulty is high enough that it’s unlikely you’ll get through. You’ll come to this door again from the other side once you reach the Dank Crypt. Be warned that this is a one-way route in. You’ll be jumping into a hole, and you can’t jump back out. North from the Overgrown Ruins waypoint (and east of the Roadside Cliffs waypoint), you’ll come to the Chapel Entrance. Here, you’ll run into Gimblebock and Taman, who are with a group trying to break into the ruins. You can talk them (and their two friends) out of heading to the crashed ship, or you can fight them. No matter how you handle them, look for the cracked tiles near the stairs. There’s a rock hanging above the crack. Shoot the Coiled Rope to drop it. (If you’re careful on your approach, you can just shoot the rope before talking to Gimblebock and Taman, killing them instantly.) This will open a hole into the Bedchamber beneath you. From the statue in the Chapel Entrance, head east. There’s a narrow path there that leads to a locked Wooden Hatch. If you can get it open, that hatch leads to the Dank Crypt. If you continue north from the Chapel Entrance, you’ll reach an Ornate Door — make sure you loot the Backpack and Burlap Sack by the bedroll on the left as you go past which are super easy to miss because they’re hard to see. You can lockpick this door or talk your way past Andorn. Inside, you’ll have to fight him. The rest of Gimblebock’s party is behind the next door, and you’ll have to fight them as well. Your first task in the Bedchamber is to fight five members of Gimblebock’s party (not counting Andorn the doorman). As you head south, there’s a locked door (“No lock, no handle. How does it open?”) Continue south into the library. At the south end, there’s a statue in an alcove. Behind that statue, there are a couple chests. While walking around that alcove, you’ll do some passive Perception checks (you won’t click on anything, but the game will roll dice for you). If you (or any of your party) pass, you’ll find a skull-shaped lever. Pull it to unlock that door, and you’ll find another door leading to the Dank Crypt. (If you miss this lever, you’ll have to go back to the cliffside path (above) to reach the Dank Crypt.) The first room of the Dank Crypt has a few chests and two sets of Heavy Oak Doors. One set is locked. It’s possible to lockpick them with Thieves’ Tools, but retrieving the key is easier. The unlocked Heavy Oak Doors lead to a room full of sarcophaguses (sarcophagi?). Skip the sarcophagus in the center at first, and loot the rest of the room (the sarcophagi along the sides are safe to open). You’ll make several more passive Perception checks as you explore to reveal Vents, Gargoyle Heads, and a Button. When you open the main sarcophagus, the Vents will release Grease, and the Garygoyle Heads will fire flaming arrows. You have a few options to deal with them. The central sarcophagus contains The Watcher’s Guide and an Engraved Key. The door at the south end of this chamber is the Ancient Door where you met Shadowheart. Through the locked Heavy Oak Doors, the next room has a statue of Jergal (there will be a passive Religion check for your party as you approach), several Entombed Scribes’ corpses, and a couple of Gilded Chests. You can attempt to open the Book of Dead Gods with Arcana, Strength, or Dexterity checks. Inside, you’ll find another sheet of paper requiring a Religion check. If and when you decipher it, you’ll get a spell scroll. (We got a Scroll of Ray of Enfeeblement, but this might be random.) In the northeast corner of the main room, take the steps up into the alcove. Another passive Perception check will (hopefully) reveal a Button. This must be a low difficulty because we’ve never failed it. Push it to open a hidden door … and bring five of the Entombed Scribes back to life. (You can loot them again after they’re defeated for some extra weapons and gold.) Inside the hidden room, open the Heavy Chest for The Amulet of Lost Voices — a Very Rare item that lets the wearer cast Speak with Dead. In that same room, interact with the Richly Adorned Sarcophagus. This will introduce you to the Hooded Skeleton. Assuming you don’t attack him, your conversation with him is not really informative. Eventually, he’ll travel to your Camp — you’ll find him standing on the beach to the north. There, he’ll offer to Resurrect any fallen party members for 200 gold.

One of the best companions players can recruit in Baldur's Gate 3 is Karlach, a fiery and rather chipper Tiefling Barbarian. Having escaped the Nine Hells, Karlach arrives on the Sword Coast only to find herself hunted by the minions of the archdevil Zariel, including Wyll, the party's resident Warlock. Players can find and recruit Karlach or bring about a much darker ending to her story. Assuming Karlach isn't selected as a premade Origin Hero during character creation, she will appear a few hours into Act One. Like most other companions, Karlach can be befriended and even romanced if players play a noble hero who wears their heart on their sleeve. However, finding and recruiting Karlach isn't so simple, as doing so has lasting story consequences. Baldur's Gate 3 offers both premade Origin heroes and custom characters as options, and figuring out which choice is better can be difficult. To find Karlach, head to the end of a small path just off the Risen Road at coordinates X: 108, Y:510, near the Toll House. If Wyll is spoken to at the Emerald Grove, he will mention he is sworn to hunt Karlach down. His personal quest, ""The Blade of Frontiers,"" will mark Karlach's general location on the map. After leaving Emerald Grove, the party can take two different approaches. The first involves following the general layout of the land by heading west and then south and clearing quests and activities from BG3's Act One checklist. While this feels more natural, players must play for a few more hours before Karlach can be recruited. Certain party compositions may be left disadvantaged without her rage and brute strength, especially on Tactician difficulty and in Honor Mode playthroughs. Instead, after recruiting Scratch the dog near the Blighted Village entrance, players can jump over the river to the north to reach the Risen Road early. This route bypasses some early quests and encounters, which can always be completed later. Once the party has crossed the river, head to find Karlach. Once players find Karlach, it becomes obvious that she isn't a merciless and bloodthirsty devil but rather an unlucky Tiefling swept up in the Blood War and forced to serve Zariel. She was also present on the Nautiloid and was infected by a mind flayer parasite, much like the rest of the party. Players can: Karlach will start her new partnership with the party by immediately proposing they hunt down and kill some of Zariel's minions at the nearby Toll House. Zariel's minions can be found at the Toll House, pretending to be Paladins of Tyr. However, player characters have multiple ways to figure out the truth, such as using the Detect Thoughts spell, passing an Insight check, or even using Speak with Dead on nearby corpses. Tyr's clerics receive a unique dialogue option when confronting the impostor Paladins, which immediately reveals their deception. Alternatively, Karlach can be killed. If he takes Karlach's head, Wyll will be visited by his patron, Mizora, who grants him the unique Infernal Robe set. However, unless players opt for a truly evil playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3, recruiting Karlach is the best choice, both for general party composition and a richer storytelling experience.

Baldur’s Gate 3 has wowed the public with its adaptation of Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition rules in a video game setting. But that might also leave some scratching their heads over some of the details. There are a lot of terms and concepts that are second nature to DnD veterans that beginners to Baldur’s Gate 3 might find a little confusing. Set around 120 years after Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn, Baldur’s Gate 3 pits a group of heroes against mind flayers and cultists to save the world of Faerûn. Joined by the unique companions of Baldur’s Gate 3, each with their own special skills and personalities, the game tells an epic story. This mirrors the DnD experience of adventuring with a party, meaning that some familiarity with the source material is helpful. Related: 5 Best Classes for Beginners in Baldur’s Gate 3 Baldur’s Gate 3 is set in the DnD fifth edition world of Toril in the Forgotten Realms, and specifically on the continent of Faerûn. Baldur’s Gate is a city in a region known as the Sword Coast, and this area is where most DnD fifth edition campaigns are set. Forgotten Realms was created in the 1960s by Ed Greenwood and has been added to significantly over the decades. The result is a medieval fantasy setting where magic and the supernatural sit side by side with tons of lore to get lost in. Luckily, even without familiarity with the Forgotten Realms and Faerûn, it's easy to dive straight into Baldur’s Gate 3, as the game does a great job of introducing the setting. Mind flayers, also called illithids, play a key role in Baldur’s Gate 3, but outside of being mentioned in Stranger Things, there aren't many mentions of the creature in modern pop culture. Mind flayers are some of the most terrifying enemies in DnD due to their ability to control other beings. Found most often in the Astral Plane and the Underdark, mind flayers are part of a hive mind that seeks to rule over others. Once possessing a vast empire that spanned many worlds, the mind flayers numbers were significantly reduced after their githyanki slaves revolted. Mind flayers look like tall humanoids, often with purplish skin and a mass of tentacles on their faces, which they use to grab their prey in order to eat their brains. NPCs in Baldur’s Gate 3 will react differently to characters depending on their race. While some of those differences are minor, others are more startling, such as the hatred and slurs thrown at drow and tieflings. Those unfamiliar with the Forgotten Realms might be confused and even angry to see such blatant racism, and one of the earliest places this can be seen in action is in the Druid Grove with the tiefling refugees. The lore behind this behavior comes down to the history of each race. Drow are known as dark elves, who chose to follow an evil god rather than remain part of the elven pantheon; as such, they are also seen as evil. Tieflings, on the other hand, are descendants of those who made pacts with devils and, again, are seen as evil in the eyes of others as a result. There are lots of other examples, such as duergar and deep gnomes being at odds and half-elves getting the odd comment. Related: Every Playable D&D Race In Baldur's Gate 3 Getting back to the basics of DnD mechanics in Baldur’s Gate 3, learning the differences between long and short rests and how to use them can be the difference between life and death. In DnD, a short rest is an opportunity to heal up a little between combat encounters and lets some class abilities reset. In Baldur’s Gate 3, short rests have the same function, healing the party for half their max hit points and letting some class-specific features reset. Two short rests are possible per long rest in Baldur’s Gate 3. Long rests in DnD fully heal the party, reset all abilities, and allow for spells to be changed for certain classes. In Baldur’s Gate 3, long rests do the same. On top of healing everyone, resetting abilities, and recovering short rests, long rests are also key to moving the story forward, as many important moments happen in dreams. Another term newer in DnD and Baldur’s Gate 3 that might be confusing is multiclassing. Multiclassing is exactly what it sounds like, as characters can choose to add a secondary class beyond the one they initially chose. This allows different features from different classes to be mixed, creating some brilliant results. There is even a Jack-of-all-Trades Steam achievement for Baldur’s Gate 3 for those that multiclass all 12 classes in the game. In many fantasy RPGs, magic use is regulated by a stat usually called mana or magicka; however, as Baldur’s Gate 3 is an adaption of DnD, it uses spell slots instead. Spell slots dictate how many spells a spellcaster can use and at what level before they need to rest. Spell slots increase as the character levels up, letting cast more between each long rest. On the topic of spellcasting in Baldur’s Gate 3, the game also shares a commonality with DnD by including more commonly used spells called cantrips. In the plainest terms, a cantrip is a smaller, simpler form of magic that isn’t as powerful as a full spell. Full spells come in increasing levels, with each level getting more powerful and complex. It’s also important to note that cantrips don’t use spell slots, making them very useful during long combat encounters and essential for warlocks with limited spell slots. Related: Baldur’s Gate 3: Cantrips Guide (What They Are & How They Work) In Baldur’s Gate 3 there are three different types of actions characters can take: actions, bonus actions, and reactions. This is known as action economy and dictates how much any creature can do on its turn. Actions include things like attacking with a weapon or spell, dashing, using an object, or helping a downed companion. Bonus actions vary depending on class but are usually smaller actions. Reactions are actions triggered by a specific set of circumstances. Baldur’s Gate 3 does a great job of breaking down actions, bonus actions, and reactions on the hotbar to let players know what they have available. Speaking of reactions, one of the most commonly used reactions in Baldur’s Gate 3 and DnD is an attack of opportunity. This is triggered when a creature moves out of the melee range of another creature it is in combat with. So, if an enemy tries to move away from a companion or summon, the option to react will be given. Be warned, as enemies can also make attacks of opportunity too. Finally, if all goes wrong in a fight, the death saving throws mechanic kicks in. In Baldur’s Gate 3, these are done automatically, but in DnD, they are done manually. Death saves happen when a character is knocked unconscious, and they must roll a d20 to determine if they live or die. Any roll higher than a 10 is a success, and three successes will stabilize the characters. However, three fails will lead to death. If this occurs, the undead Baldur’s Gate 3 NPC Withers back at camp can revive the fallen. Death saves are an unfortunate part of DnD and Baldur’s Gate 3 and something that every party will become familiar with at some point.

If there's one thing that's certain, it's that players probably missed a cool quest on their first playthrough of Baldur's Gate 3. From early in Act 1, all the party's decisions have consequences that impact future quests, so skipping certain areas or overlooking some interesting NPCs is bound to happen. Depending on the play style, or if players are going into the game blind, it's likely there are quests that most people never even realize existed at all. [Warning: Spoilers for Baldur's Gate 3.] For some, this is part of the appeal of Baldur's Gate 3, and adds to the replayability of the game. The sprawling and intertwining storylines often reward players with powerful, one-of-a-kind weapons and armor, while others open up future adventures or introduce new characters, enemies, and areas. Below are the top 10 quests you probably missed while exploring Baldur's Gate 3. Anyone attempting a peaceful playthrough is likely to miss this quest, ""Steal the Sacred Idol,"" because it requires a little mischief and exploration. Crucially, the party must gain Mol's respect, and the most effective way to do this is to head to the Secluded Cove. Defeating the harpies there allows players to rescue Mirkon and seek out Mol in her hideout. She will ask them to steal the druid idol in the Sacred Pool, but be careful. Getting caught is definitely not good for the tieflings. This quest requires some cunning choices and overcoming difficult enemies, plus the end result has dramatic consequences for the grove and the rest of the playthrough. Completing this quest is how players will obtain the Ring of Protection, a unique rare item that is useful for just about any build, especially early in Act 1. ""Free the Artist"" stretches from Act 1 to Act 3 and can be missed if players aren't eager to go through multiple encounters around Baldur's Gate. The party will need to free the held hostage in the Zhentarim Basement, Oskar Fevras. The real quest begins once players reach Lady Jannath's Estate in Act 3, where it turns out something supernatural is amiss. Lady Jannath and Oskar are having a poltergeist issue they could use some help with. Each of the possible endings has interesting rewards, including two unique
 
rings, as well as a charming painting by Oskar. Eventually, the party will find a letter to Oskar in his workshop from the Mystic Carrion, which points them to Philgrave's Mansion. After acquiring the Torch of Revocation, the spirit of Kerri Evenfield will be back in Oskar's atelier and players will need to decide how to deal with Oskar and the love triangle. Each of the possible endings has interesting rewards, including two unique rings, as well as a charming painting by Oskar. ""Help the Spirit of the Amulet"" is easily missed because it involves crossing a lake of lava and avoiding a giant Lava Elemental. Deep in the Grymforge, the party may come across the Dark Justiciar's Journal and learn about a lost amulet in the Adamantine Forge. After traversing a lake of bubbling lava and avoiding the elemental, the Sentient Amulet can be found in a chest on a small platform. Speaking with the amulet will introduce the party to the spirit of the monk trapped inside and begin a long quest that ends in a crypt under the Open Hand Temple in Act 3. The amulet is also very useful for a monk build, as it offers extra Ki restoration each long rest. ""Find the Blood of Lathander"" is one of the best and most elusive quests in Baldur's Gate 3 due to the many puzzles required to find it. The reward for completing it is tasty though – one of the rarest items in the game: The Blood of Lathander mace. The party will have to travel through the Mountain Pass and solve the ""ceremonial weapons"" puzzle, eventually obtaining the Dawnmaster's Crest. The Blood of Lathander is a legendary weapon in Baldur's Gate 3 that you can find by exploring a Monastery for ceremonial artifacts during a quest. Once the party has entered the Inquisitor's chambers in the Githyanki crèche, they will find a hidden doorway after rotating some nearby statues. They will then face yet another series of traps before finding an altar where they can place the crest and acquire the legendary mace. It is also possible to complete this quest without the crest by using brute force. However, doing this will activate a devastating trap that obliterates the entire monastery. In a dark corner of the Shadow-Cursed Lands on the Ruined Battlefield, a Shadar-Kai named He Who Was can be found in a ritual circle with his faithful raven and a dead body nearby. He Who Was will ask players to find a ledger in a nearby tavern, The Waning Moon, which he will use to extract information from the dead body. When players bring the mysterious bird man his ledger, they will take part in a sinister interrogation on the corpse that can get pretty bloody. Any Edgar Allan Poe fans will be keen to complete this quest for the Raven Gloves, which let players summon Quoth the Raven as a companion. If the party isn't paying attention, they can accidentally bypass the Adamantine Forge, a massive area with an epic boss fight. There will be clues about this location throughout the entire journey in the Underdark. When the party finally reaches the forge, activating it will trigger the fight against Grym, which can be very tricky without a solid strategy. Using the environment to the party's advantage is effective here – just lure Grym into the center and drop the forge hammer on his head to leave him prone and deal major damage. Careful though, doing this will spawn some annoying Magma Mephits out of the surrounding lava. Defeating Grym awards the Grymskull Helm, and also allows players to use the forge to create two legendary items out of Mithral Ore. One of the most infamously strange quests in all of Baldur's Gate 3 that is too often passed over, ""Help the Devilish Ox,"" requires the party to resist prying too deeply into a sassy Ox's motives. Not only must players avoid upsetting the Ox in dialogue, they also must ensure the beast is not killed before Act 3. The Strange Ox is one of the weirder Baldur's Gate 3 characters that players can stumble upon through their journey, but he does come with rewards. If he survives to Act 3, players have the option to help the Strange Ox. If they do, he will reveal his true intentions, and the party will have to decide whether to smuggle the beast into the city, or turn against him and battle it out against a ninth-level ooze monster. Both have their benefits, but if the party is planning for the endgame, smuggling the creature into Baldur's Gate will make him available as a summon in the final battle. When adventurers first enter Rivington, the abandoned windmill seems like a pretty innocuous building in the middle of a field. If players listen close, however, they will hear screaming in the area that leads to the basement where an unconscious mind flayer lays prone. The party can choose to attack the creature or wake him up and talk with him to find that he is a little hungry – for human brains. Either way, completing this quest rewards one illithid power and the Ring of Truthfulness, which grants advantage on insight checks and is useful for detecting lies. This quest offers some interesting background on mind flayers, but is also a great place to earn inspiration for a Dark Urge run. ""Stop the Presses"" is often failed or missed because it is time-sensitive, and reaching the basement area without turning NPCs hostile is relatively difficult. Interacting with Ettvard Needle at the Baldur's Mouth will reveal that a negative article is going to be printed about you, and if the party wishes to stop the hit piece, they need to do it before a long rest. Descending into the Baldur's Mouth basement through the elevator nearby, the party will find Jelliwig, a sentient printing press that will hint to players that they need to replace the printing block with a more favorable article before the next day. Successfully changing the article to a positive one gives players a gain of +10 Attitude and an improved reputation around town, which affects merchant prices and opens up unique dialogue with some vendors. If the party was trying to avoid the evil path, they probably missed ""Impress The Murder Tribunal"" in Act 3. As a sub-quest of ""Get Orin's Netherstone,"" it suggests that players will need to make some evil decisions and possibly murder a lot of innocent NPCs. While there are ways around shedding too much blood, the murderous route is a viable one for anybody attempting a Dark Urge run. In addition to some amazing legendary gear, this quest delves into Bhaal's backstory and the Cult of Bhaal. More significantly, players will find Sarevok Anchev, a classic Baldur's Gate antagonist, to discuss both his ties to Orin and the Murder Tribunal and its purpose. Eventually, the party must decide to either kill Valeria and become an unholy assassin of Bhaal, or turn against Sarevok and kill him. Turning on him rewards Sarevok's Horned Helmet and the Sword of Chaos, and saving Valeria makes her available as an endgame summon. Of all the quests likely missed, this one is probably the bloodiest and most rewarding in all of Baldur's Gate 3 in terms of both loot and backstory. Developed and published by Larian Studios, Baldur's Gate 3 is an upcoming role-playing game set to release in August of 2023. Players will create a character to embark on a large-scale journey and can do so solo or cooperatively with a friend. Combat is a turn-based style this time around.

It's also extremely easy to steal. Just finish the Kagha quest so the ritual of thorns stops.  At this point no one of looking at the idol / line of sight. Walk up to it, summon a mage hand, hide, turn based mode on, hand throws idol next to you, pick up, and leave.  No one will see you do it, and they don't react to the left for 10 seconds or so. 🤘 Wow I missed every one of these.  Gonna have to boot this one up for another playthrough… Still not out of act 1 but did all of the ones on this list possible so far. Except I did not like the result of the sacred idol quest so reloaded and went a different route lol. Only after laying waste to both goblin camp and Grove and halsin. Patch eight will introduce the circle of stars druid to Baldur's Gate 3, and with it, a new way to use a druid's wild shape feature. Shonen Jump's Drama Queen is gathering attention and criticism from Western fans, but it shows they still don't know much about Japan. 2024's 15 highest grossing movies, including Wicked and Bad Boys: Ride or Die, have a wide range of genres but they all have one sad fact in common. Cobra Kai season 6 has a surprising connection to one storyline that ran through season 3, but it does so in a much more definitive way.

Here’s how it works. Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best companions you can find, a tiefling Barbarian with a heavy metal backstory, hunted by Wyll and the Paladins of Tyr. There are several outcomes to this Baldur's Gate 3 questline, but obviously you need to make a few specific choices if you want Karlach Demonsbane as a party member in. With that in mind, we'll cover Karlach's location in BG3, how you can get her as a companion, and if she's looking for romance!  We've got Karlach's location laid out for you on the map above. Karlach is simply sitting on a rock at the end of the path known as the Risen Road, while Anders and his warriors are in the abandoned Tollhouse in the ruined town North of her. To find Karlach and Anders, the only real option we know of at the time of writing is to get into the Blighted Village and head North, then East. Keep in mind that the village is occupied by Goblins (though some dialogue checks will convince them to let you through), but the path leading East above the village is occupied by monstrous Gnolls - and there's no dialogue check that'll convince them that they want to do anything other than eat your gizzards.  Don't worry, all you romantic sorts - by all accounts Karlach will be one of the many Baldur's Gate 3 romances in the final release of the game, though in early access that's currently not an option. All party members have romance options and dialogue to form relationships with them, and right now there's no indication that Karlach is going to be an exception to that rule, especially when it's already confirmed that the Baldur's Gate 3 Halsin companion will be a literal bear you can seduce.  In the early access version of Baldur's Gate 3 Karlach was only being hunted by the Paladin Anders and his team, but now in the full release Karlach is also being pursued by Wyll, fellow party member and the Blade of Frontiers. You'll have the choice about whether to hear her out or help one of the factions pursuing her, so we'll cover the major details below. Obviously there are spoilers for the Hunt the Devil quest, so keep in mind when reading on. With all that said, we definitely suggest that you choose to side with Karlach, to kill Anders and his team. Aside from the fact that Karlach is basically an innocent trying to escape a horrible existence as a slave warrior trapped in literal Hell, Anders' willingness to throw others in the fire to save himself suggests he's not as much of a tragic hero as he claims. You also want to make sure that Wyll hears Karlach out, as once he realises that she's not a real devil but just a normal person, he's horrified at the idea of hurting her and the pair of them quickly become friends. Helping Karlach ensures you get her to join the team as a companion, and she's a good one, a worthy tank and melee fighter on the battlefield. By killing Anders, you also get his sword - a powerful weapon for those who can handle a greatsword. © GamesRadar+.

Here’s how it works. The best Baldur's Gate 3 weapons are spread across the game, getting more powerful as you get through the three acts and both found in the main story and in secret side quests. Baldur's Gate 3 has a massive range of weapons, many of which are magical, and suited for all sorts of classes and builds across BG3. If you want the best weapons you can find, as well as a clear and detailed explanation for how weapons work, weapon proficiency, and the difference between simple and martial weapons in Baldur's Gate 3, the following guide will help you in every step of the way!

All characters in Baldur's Gate 3 can use all weapons, but if they're not trained in proficiency with them, they won't get their proficiency bonus on rolls to hit, as outlined in our guide on Baldur's Gate 3 skills and proficiency. They also won't be able to use certain skills tied to that weapon - so while you can technically swing it around, you really won't be getting the most out of it.

Long and short rests in Baldur's Gate 3
Baldur's Gate 3 advantage and disadvantage The vast majority of weapons you're proficient with will be decided by your Baldur's Gate 3 class, but there are other ways to become proficient. For example, Dwarves are automatically given proficiency in certain weapons like hammers and axes in character creation, while certain subclasses also can grant proficiencies later on. There is no benefit to getting ""proficient"" in a weapon more than once - for example, a Dwarf Fighter is given proficiency in Battleaxes twice, from both their Race and Class, but they get no benefits over an Elf or Human Fighter. Proficiency is a binary thing - you have it or you don't. You can't be proficient twice. You can check what weapons you're proficient with by opening your inventory in-game and selecting the weapon icon on the left, which will tell you what weapons that character can use to their utmost.  All weapons in Baldur's Gate 3 fall into two categories - simple weapons and martial weapons. There's actually no significant difference between the two except that martial weapons tend to be a bit better. They're broken up into those two categories as an easy way to split them up - classes that don't really focus on melee combat tend to only be proficient with simple weapons and maybe a few extras, while appropriately-named ""martial classes"" like the Fighter and Paladin can use both simple and martial weapons. They're broken up as follows:  Every weapon in Baldur's Gate 3 has at least one or more weapon properties listed at the bottom of its description, which affect how it's used and how it works in combat.

Where to go after the crashed ship in Baldur's Gate 3 You may feel like you should stick together and do an epic, back-to-back hero fight with the rest of your companions against the forces of evil, but we’d truly advise you do the opposite during  Baldur's Gate 3 combat. Why? For two, simple reasons… The first is that the more bunched up you are, the easier it is for enemy spellcasters or rogues to use items or powerful Baldur's Gate 3 spells like Grease, Oil and more to inconvenience you all. If you’re spread out, there is less chance for all of your party to be hit. Which leads us to our second point - strategizing. The further apart you are - though, to be clear, your party should be nearby - the more room there is to strategize where you want your companions to go. For example, Lae’zel with a bow? She has a superior jumping ability to get on the higher ground faster. This compliments with Astarion’s sneaking abilities, which can take our enemies that Lae’zel misses down on the ground.  Believe it or not, enemies can jump out of nowhere at times and leave you feeling uncertain on what to do next. Sometimes it can mean certain death and having to quickly work out how to revive dead characters in Baldur's Gate 3, especially if you haven’t had a short or long rest in a long time. If you’re unsure what’s ahead of you, the best option is to go and stealth your way through. If there are enemies about, then turn on combat time, wait for 6 seconds and then move when you feel that you aren’t going to be spotted. Sometimes you’re able to bypass whole swathes of combat like this, and while you may feel you aren’t getting as much fights in your game, finding some sweet loot more than makes up for it. Besides, you don’t have to leave the fights for good - you can always come back later and pick the stragglers up!  All your team will have strengths and weaknesses with different items so make sure you pay attention to things like what Baldur's Gate 3 weapons and armor they're using. Plus, some gear just has basic pros and cons for example whoever's using it. For example, playing as a Fighter with chainmail? Sure, you’ve got a higher AC (Armour Class), but you also have a -1 in your Stealth. So maybe don’t try and hide next to your Rogue, because you’re going to end up screwing both of you over. The same goes for weapons. Weapon proficiency lets you know what weapons you can and can’t wield without putting yourself at a disadvantage. It’s blocked out from equipping anyway, but it helps when trying to buy something new for your character/companions. Seriously, don’t buy something that you end up not even being able to use. It really sucks!  Knowing which companions in Baldur's Gate 3 work best together is important. If you have a team of all tank-like classes with zero healing or ranged spells, it’s not going to go well against a more varied team of enemies. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with having another companion similar to you, but keep in mind that having a good selection of melee and range abilities will make even the hardest fights that much simpler. For the best Baldur's Gate 3 party composition, check out our guide!  You don't need to know Dungeons and Dragons well to play Baldur’s Gate 3, but it’s still helpful to check on your character sheet. It’ll have your stats that and will let you see what Baldur's Gate 3 skills you have proficiency in, and what you’re most likely to succeed in when you give that dice a roll. For example, a dexterity of 16 will give you +3 to all Dexterity based skills, and that's even before you get proficiency bonuses on them. The character sheet also provided helpful information about how much damage you can do with your weapons, as well as your armor class/AC. This allows you to plan which character can go up front and handle the most damage, while seeing who's best at the back, where their lower AC isn’t so much of a problem. Your character sheet provides other intel, too - like your spells, the actions you can take, and your spell DC (Difficulty Class). There’s a load of information there so play around with it and see what helps you!  When it comes to combat you’ve got a whole party of different abilities to choose from - from simply hacking at enemies, shooting them with arrows, to setting them on fire with magic and more. But combat doesn’t just stop here. If the enemy are off the ground you might find a perfect opportunity to shove them off a ledge to their death below. While you may also shove them into unreachable places and lose any loot, the satisfaction of dropping them down a deep hole to never be seen again is oddly satisfying. Don’t just let yourself be sucked in by the art of shoving, though. Throwing stuff at enemies, whether it be your boots, your companion’s corpse, or an apple, can also bring some hilarity to your combat. It helps that no matter what you throw, it will cause damage to the enemy in some way.  Much like BioWare’s Dragon Age: Origins, the camp is a great place for you to get to know your companions after a long day of beating the crap out of goblins and bandits. The more you know and understand them, the more knowledge you get of them and what they like and don’t like. If you’re lucky, you may even get the chance to start one of the many Baldur's Gate 3 romances... The camp also has a more practical use. While you are able to regain some spell slots and health with a short rest, you can take the opportunity to have take long rests in Baldur's Gate 3 and regain all your health and spell slots. © GamesRadar+.
