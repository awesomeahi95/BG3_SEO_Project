Multiclassing allows you to build a character with a combination of more than one class. Instead of leveling up in the same class, you are able to level up in a different class at the expense of higher-level class features you would get if you continued to level up in your initial class.
Baldur’s Gate 3 has a level maximum of Level 12 for characters. If you are multiclassing, the levels of your multiple classes will add up to 12. For example, you could start playing as a Druid for the first two levels and then multiclass with a Monk for the remaining ten levels. Your character would be multiclassing at Level 12 as a Level 2 Druid and Level 10 Monk combined.
ADVERTISEMENT
You can only level up one class at a time. This also allows you to alternate which class you level up. The level-up screen will have all the classes you are combining for your multiclass and you can switch between them. For example, you can start as a Druid at Level 1, take Monk at the next level up, and then go back to Druid on your next level up.
Learn more about classes and subclasses to plan out which combinations of classes you would want for your multiclass. You can experiment with different builds and also take into consideration what abilities your companions and party members would work well together! As a rule of thumb, it's best to choose classes that prioritize the same stats - for example, the quintessential Bardlock (Bard and Warlock) or Sorlock (Sorcerer Warlock) which all use Charisma to cast. Check out the classes page for a breakdown of each Class's attributes!
How to Access Multiclassing
Multiclassing is available once your character reaches Level 2. On the level-up screen, you can preview which features are available for the next level of your starting class. In the ‘Level Up’ box on the left, you’ll find a button with the class symbol. Hover over this button and select ‘Add Class’.
This will take you to all of the class options for you to choose from. You can customize your subclass and other class features from this page. Your existing class level(s) will also be displayed on the corresponding class icon, including how many levels you have in that class. If you change your mind and want to stay with your initial class, then select ‘Cancel’ to return back to the previous menu.
ADVERTISEMENT
If you are beyond Level 1, you can still multiclass your current character without starting over by respeccing. See Changing Your Multiclass Build below.
Also, if you are joining a multiplayer campaign and your party is Level 2 or higher, then you will be able to multiclass your character up to the level of the party.
Changing Your Multiclass Build
ADVERTISEMENT
Multiclassing can be fun to experiment with builds, but sometimes it might not be working out for your character or party composition. Don’t worry, you can always respec your character and start over on your multiclass build.
To change your class, you’ll need to find Withers. You will be able to change your class for a cost of 100 gold. Check out our guide on how to find Withers and respec your class for more details!
This will take you back to Level 1 where you can customize your initial class. From there, you’ll be able to level up back to whatever level you reached and follow the same multiclass instructions to change your build.

How To Multiclass
One of the greatest joys in a CRPG like Baldur's Gate 3 is tinkering with your build, experimenting with different level-up options and turning your characters into highly-optimised fighting machines with specialized, unique roles. Add the ability to multiclass to the mix, and you have access to entirely new worlds of optimization and experimentation.

Baldur's Gate 3: How To Get The Owlbear Cub
BG3 ups the stakes by allowing players to have an owlbear cub at their camps. Here's how to obtain the half-bear, half-owl creature.
Multiclassing is a staple of Dungeons & Dragons, allowing you to mix and match the features of multiple classes. Some combinations are classics, such as the famed Sorcadin (that's a Paladin with some Sorcerer powers, by the way), while some potential combinations are a bit more... out there.
Updated January 13, 2024: Need more help multiclassing? We've included a video version of this guide to help you juggle multiple classes at once and added some details on how the process works with more than two classes.
What Is Multiclassing?
Multiclassing is baked right into Baldur's Gate 3's level-up system. As soon as you have enough experience to boost up to the next level, you can opt to multiclass. There are some things you should keep in mind when doing this:
Multiclassing will not automatically grant you the proficiencies normally granted by your new class.
Your starting HP is based on the class you spend your first level on, so it's a good idea to pick the class with the higher hit-die as your first level unless your second class has the proficiencies you require for your build.
Each class levels up separately.
In the image above, for example, the character is a Level 3 Monk and Level 1 Cleric. This means that despite having enough experience for four levels, he only has the powers and abilities of a Level 3 Monk and a Level 1 Cleric.
Generally speaking, multiclass builds trade raw power in a single class for the versatility of multiple classes. This can lead to them being more versatile or well-rounded, but they often won't be able to perform a single class's role as efficiently as one that didn't multiclass.
This is most impactful when it comes to spellcasters, who will fall behind in their spell progression when they multiclass.
How To Multiclass
Play Video
Actually multiclassing is a very simple process in Baldur's Gate 3. When you click the level-up button, you'll be brought to the level-up screen. On the page that gives you an overview of your level-up, there will be a button in the top-right that, when you hover over it, will be labelled 'Add Class'.
Clicking the Add Class button will bring you to a new menu filled with every class in the game. Select one to gain a level in that class.
Once you've got more than one class on a character, the level-up screen will then present you with all classes you have a level in, allowing you to quickly click between them to check what you'd gain for taking a level in either. This screen also has the Add Class button, allowing you to create a character with three or even more classes.
Unlike in the tabletop version of Dungeons & Dragons, there are no stat requirements for multiclassing in Baldur's Gate 3. Any character can use any class combination, no matter how ineffective they would be.
It is technically possible to create a character with a single level in every single class in the game, provided they take a new class with each level up to 12. There's even an achievement for doing this, but does leave you with a terribly unoptimised character.

How to multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3
Plus our picks for the best multiclass builds

Ryan Gilliam (he/him) has worked at Polygon for over eight years. He primarily spends his time writing guides for massively popular games like Diablo 4 & Destiny 2.
Choosing to multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3 is an extremely powerful tool that allows you to gain access to abilities from multiple classes at once. But, like in Dungeons and Dragons, multiclassing can also limit your character’s ultimate potential. Thankfully, multiclassing your character and then respeccing if you don’t like it is a very simple process, so you can experiment as much as you want.
In this Baldur’s Gate 3 guide, we’ll teach you how to multiclass; explain the multiclass requirements for, and pros and cons of, multiclassing; and suggest some of the best multiclass builds.

How to multiclass in BG3

You can multiclass in Baldur’s Gate 3 as early as level 2, and there are no restrictions on which classes you can combine together — although some obviously play much better together than others.
When you level up, look for a button in the top right of the level up panel (on the left side of your screen). You’re looking for a button that has an ax and a staff crossed on it, with a plus symbol sitting above it. If you click that button, the game will open a panel that shows how many levels you have in each class. From there, you can select a new class and level up in that instead of in your main class.
The next time you level up, you’ll see a new display that shows your two classes and their respective levels. You’ll then be able to select between the two of them or add a third subclass. Now I don’t recommend getting into more than two classes for a single character (unless you’re going for the Jack-of-all-Trades achievement) but there’s nothing actually stopping you from putting a single level into all 12 classes.
Should you multiclass in BG3?
Image: Larian Studios via Polygon
Multiclassing is a very complex decision in Baldur’s Gate 3, and you’ll need to weigh the pros and cons as you’re putting your build together.
The positives are fairly obvious. By deciding to multiclass you can:
Combine class features together to make truly busted combinations
Shore up some of the weaknesses of your main class
Gain more resources that benefit your main class, like additional spell slots
Fulfill a really cool roleplay fantasy of a heavy armored mage or a raging barbarian monk
Get even more attacks per turn
The drawbacks, however, are a bit more nuanced.
Making the decision to multiclass at all means your main class will never reach level 12, which is the max level in the game. Because of this, you might miss out on some truly amazing features, depending on your class and subclass. You’ll need to weigh that against the amazing feature combos you can get from combining with a second class.
Another con — or at least something to be aware of — is that you only gain the proficiencies of your first class. So you can’t start as a Sorcerer, decide you want to wear heavy armor, and then take a dip into Paladin. What you’d need to do there is start as a Paladin and then take the rest of your 11 levels in Sorcerer. You can’t just take a dip into a few classes and walk away with all the proficiencies.
Finally, and this is a pro or a con depending on how much of a strategy fan you are: Multiclassing can make the game very easy when playing on the standard difficulty. Building a multiclass character is typically a big investment, and you’ll probably feel a little behind once you forgo a level in your primary class and start dipping into another. But once you’re at max level and you’ve got a ton of magic items to combine together — not to mention and so much gold that you can easily tweak your class to perfection via Withers — you can become an unstoppable monster fairly simply.
Best multiclass builds in BG3
Multiclassing is a very promising and lucrative endeavor, if you make the right choices. The most powerful builds in Baldur’s Gate 3 typically involve multiclassing, and there is some real fun to be had if you put some thought into your character or follow a build guide.
If you want to try to put together your own combos, keep in mind that classes usually work best together when they share the same main stat, like Paladin, Bard, Warlock, and Sorcerer all using Charisma.
If you’d rather get some recommendations, here are three of our favorite combos:
Paladin and Pact of the Blade Warlock
Image: Larian Studios via Polygon
This combination is extremely powerful. Start with a Paladin of whatever Oath fancies you, and level it up to level 5 so you get your extra attack. Then, start taking levels in Warlock. At Warlock level 3, take Pact of the Blade and make your Paladin’s main weapon your Pact Weapon (this is extremely powerful when combined with a shield and the Blood of Lathander mace).
Once you hit Warlock level 5, you’ll gain another attack when using your Pact Weapon, and this stacks with your extra Paladin attack, giving your three weapon hits per turn. Take at least one more level in Paladin to get your Aura and the last level in whichever class you prefer. When you combine all of those attacks that use your Charisma score, an aura to buff your allies, heavy armor, Eldritch Blast, and Warlock spell slots that you can use to Divine Smite (which reset on a short rest, no less), the Palock is truly one of the most impressive builds in the game.
Thief Rogue and Gloomstalker Ranger
Image: Larian Studios via Polygon
Where some multiclass combos are like mixing chocolate and peanut butter together — two great flavors that somehow make the other even better — others are more like adding chocolate to more chocolate. That’s pretty much what you’re dealing with when it comes to the Rogue and the Ranger.
The level up process for this one is pretty simple. Start with a Rogue and level up your character three times so you can select your subclass: Thief. Thief is just a totally busted subclass on Rogue because it gives you a second Bonus Action that you can use to dash, disengage, and do several other things that leave.
Then you take the next eight levels in Ranger and pick up the Gloomstalker subclass, which is the sneaky, stealthy ranger. From this you’ll deal some massive bonus damage on your first turn of each combat (paired with Sneak Attack from Rogue, you’ll be able to take out some enemies in a single hit to start the fight), and will gain an extra attack eventually. Once you hit Ranger level 8 and get a Feat, take one more dip into Rogue to finish your leveling experience with another Feat.
This build basically just turns you into a burst damage, stealth, and mobility machine. It’s a very popular build, and a ton of fun to play.
Barbarian and Fighter
Image: Larian Studios via Polygon
Sometimes in Baldur’s Gate 3, you just want to make a character that’s really, really good at hitting stuff really, really hard. Let Gale and Wyll sling some spells. You have a date with a big hammer, your own rage, and Action Surge.
The Barbarian Fighter is a classic, powerful combo that allows you to tank your way around the battlefield beating enemies to a pulp.
For this, start as a Barbarian and level up until level 5, when you get your extra attack. That should help carry you through the first two levels of Fighter. Take Fighter to level 3 and choose the Champion subclass, which will allow you to critically attack when you roll 19 or 20 on the die. You’ll also pick up Action Surge, which allows you to gain your action back once per short rest. That means at level 8 (five in Barbarian and three in Fighter), you can strike a boss four times in a single turn. And you’ll roll a crit 1 in 10 rolls instead of 1 in 20.
Finish out the leveling process with Barbarian all the way to level 9, which will net you the Brutal Critical effect, which causes you to deal increased damage on a critical hit. As for your Barbarian subclass, I like to pair Champion with Berserker, as you’ll get yet another attack that you can use your bonus action on if you kill something.
This build basically just turns you into a whirlwind that can attack over and over again and critically strikes all the time, leading to massive damage. If you have a Cleric like Shadowheart backing you up, and a spellcaster like Gale to help you with ranged foes, you’ll chew through bosses.

Want to know how to multiclass in Baldur's Gate 3? Multiclassing opens up a wealth of synergies in Baldur's Gate 3, allowing you to blend any classes together and gain access to their features and spells. It's also far simpler than the pen and paper alternative, shedding some of the stricter elements of D&D 5e multiclassing to make it far more approachable for those new to the system with Baldur's Gate 3.
In this guide, we'll break down how to multiclass in Baldur's Gate 3, so that you can have fun creating a multi-talented adventurer who can do a little bit of everything. We'll also cover how to multiclass on Explorer difficulty, if you want to partake in some mix-and-match fun while still having an easier ride.

How to multiclass in Baldur's Gate 3
To multiclass in Baldur's Gate 3, you must first gain a level. Then, in the level up screen, click the ""Add Class"" icon in the top-right corner of the ""Level Up"" panel. When you do so, you'll be able to choose any class with which to mix your current character.

Unlike in D&D 5e, in which there are minimum attribute requirements that you must meet before you can multiclass, Baldur's Gate 3 lets you go wild without limits. That means you can multiclass into anything: Barbarian/Rogue? Sure! Warlock/Druid? Be our guest! One level in all 12 Baldur's Gate 3 classes? There's an achievement for that!

Of course, taking a level in each class doesn't grant access to every single one of their abilities. You only gain access to the abilities earned from each level in a respective class.
If you have five levels in Fighter, for example, you'll get the Extra Attack feature. A level six character with five levels of Wizard and one level of Fighter (Wizard 5/Fighter 1) will not get Extra Attack, because this is a feature that only unlocks upon reaching level five in the Fighter class, rather than your overall character level.

Multiclassing can give you access to some powerful synergies, then, but it also makes buildcrafting far more complicated. The max level for your character is level 12, so it's easy to become weaker than other characters who follow a single class for all of their adventure.
Those following a single class will gain access to the most powerful abilities upon reaching higher levels, while those who multiclass immediately sacrifice the ability to reach max level with a single class. That means they will will have a greater range of lower level abilities, but possibly nothing that can rival the toughest monsters in the game.
Multiclassing is actually disabled on the lowest difficulty, Explorer, presumably for the added complexities it brings to build composition. However, you can enable multiclassing on the lowest difficulty with the TC - Multiclass Unlocker (Full release version) mod, which you can install using Nexus mods.
That wraps up our guide on how to multiclass in Baldur's Gate 3. Of course, abilities and combat options are only one part of this sprawling CRPG. If you're trying to develop relationships with your companions, check out our guide on Baldur's Gate 3 romance.

Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager[edit | edit source]
Before doing any of these steps, please ensure that you have downloaded the Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager (simply scroll down to the Setup instructions and click on the highlighted ""Grab the latest release.""). Please note that as of Patch 9 in EA, your profile within the mod manager must be set to ""Public"" to use the mod manager properly. This option will be at the top left of the mod manager.
Find the mod you would like to download and download the file. This is usually a zip file. When downloading mods from Nexus Mods, make sure to select ""Manual Download"" to have the file downloaded to your computer.
Open the zip file. This is quite simple, all you need is a folder unarchiving software such as 7zip. Double-click the zip file and open it with the software. The zip file usually contains an info.json JSON file, README text document, and the actual mod itself which will be a .pak file.
In another window, open your file explorer and go to the mod folder for Baldur's Gate 3. The mod folder will be located at a location generally named \Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods. Please note that the \AppData\ folder is hidden by default. To be able to easily access it as well as other hidden folders, click ""View"" at the top left of the file explorer and check mark the ""Hidden Items."" box.
Go back to the window of the zip file, and drag the mod's .pak file into the ""Mods"" folder for BG3.
Open the BG3 Mod Manager. The mod you just dragged into the Mods folder should appear on the right of the screen. If it does not, try clicking Refresh above it. The Patch 3 Mod Fixer is an exception, and does not appear in the mod manager nor does it need to be activated. Repeat steps 1-4 for all the mods you want.
Click and drag all the mods to the left side of the screen. Please note that load order can be crucial for some mods, so make sure to put mods that other mods are dependent on above them in the load order. Once you have dragged all the mods you would like to use to the left side of the screen, make sure to save your load order by clicking the save button beside the ""Mod Order"" label.
Export your order to the game by clicking the first icon beside the word ""Export"" at the top bar.
BONUS STEP FOR DIRECTX 11 USERS: You will need to enable DirectX 11 mode for the mods to work if you are using that version of the game. Simply click ""Settings"" in the top most bar, click on ""Open Preferences"", tick ""Enable DirectX 11 Mode"" then click on ""Save"" at the bottom.
Launching the game: You will need to launch the game through the mod manager for most of the mods to work properly. At the top bar, beside ""Shortcuts"", there are a few icons; a file icon that will automatically open the Mods folder mentioned in step 3, an icon that opens the workshop folder, an icon that opens the logs, and the BG3 icon. Click on the BG3 icon to launch the game. The launcher should open, and you should be able to simply press play and enjoy your mods. Note that some mods need you to turn off the sending of analytical data to Larian, which you can do at the launcher by simply going into settings at the bottom left.

For mods that aren't .pak files, you will need to follow any instructions the mod author has posted. Usually, mods that replace base game files need to be placed in the downloaded files, usually in Program Files(x86) then the app you used to download the game, then in Baldurs Gate 3\Data or bin. Be sure to follow the mod author's instructions.
Manually[edit | edit source]
Download the mod(s).
Unzip into the Mods folder using a program like 7zip.
If the mod comes with its modsettings code in the description or pinned in the Posts section use that.
Add the mod to the modsettings.lsx file located in PlayerProfiles/Public.
Save and exit.
If no code is provided you'll have to make it yourself. This is easy.
Open \Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\modsettings.lsx.
Copy and paste the GustavDev entry below itself. From <node id=""ModuleShortDesc""> to the closing </node>.
Change Name, Folder, and UUID to match the info.json that should have come with the mod you are currently installing.
Save and exit.
Repeat either 3 or 4 as needed for each mod you want to install.
Set modsettings.lsx to read only. If this isn't done, the game will overwrite the file and changes will have to be made again.

If the mod you are installing doesn't come with an info.json, ask the mod author nicely to either provide one or supply the code for manual installation.
Mod Order[edit | edit source]
Some mods have load order requirements. In the example below, the section with <node id=""ModOrder""> determines what order your mods are loaded in. BG3MM and Vortex do this automatically, but if you're on Mac or Linux it's very important to set this up correctly if you have lots of mods installed.
Gustav should always be the first item loaded in this file, as it's the whole game.
The mod order you need depends on what the descriptions of each mod you have downloaded states. Please carefully read the description, comments, and bugs sections of any mod you download.

How to Install Mods
BY EM STONHAM, BRANDON RAD, LYNETTE GUZMAN, +28 MORE
UPDATED
SEP 20, 2024
With the launch of Patch 7 on PC, Baldur's Gate III now contains full mod integration. Here's how to install mods using the various methods.

Autoplay setting: On
Baldur's Gate 3 - How to Install Mods (Patch 7)
The In-Game Mod Manager
First, there’s the obvious: the in-game mod manager is accessible right from the title screen. This is by far the easiest way to mod your game as you can just click Download to add a particular mod to your install window. Then, you can just double check that the mod has a green checkmark to it to ensure that it’s installed. 
A Note On Console Mods
As of right now, while PC is on Patch 7 and offers full in-game mod support, console versions of BG3 are still on Patch 6. This means no official mod support on console, and cross saves between console and PC are disabled. These restrictions should be lifted when consoles receive Patch 7, but even then they'll go through a more strenuous curation process, meaning the amount of console mods will probably be far fewer than PC.
ADVERTISEMENT

If you would rather browse on the Baldur's Gate 3 Website, you can search, filter, and subscribe to mods directly from the there and they’ll be added to your in-game mod manager. It may ask you to make a mod.io account and/or connect your steam account, but once you have everything set, it’s just as easy as using the in-game mod manager.
While using the in-game manager will give you a greater likelihood that things will just work, there's also a restriction on the kind of mods you'll find there, such as ones that heavily alter the game script. For things like that, you'll want to go third-party with something like Nexus Mods or the Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager.
Nexus Mods
One of the most popular third-party options is Nexus Mods, and its mod manager, Vortex. You just need to make an account, download Vortex, and add those mods through the Nexus Mods website. When downloading each mod, it will tell you any mod dependencies that you’ll need to also download to make that mod work, and whether you’ll actually need a different mod manager, such as the Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager that we discuss down below.
You may get a few error messages thrown your way, but Vortex does a pretty good job of letting you know what the problems and suggested solutions are.
Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager
ADVERTISEMENT
The BG3 Mod Manager from LaughingLeader is another third-party way to install mods. If you don't feel like using Vortex, or you're using a mod that actually requires BG3MM, you can download it from GitHub at the above link. Full steps needed for that particular Mod Manager can be found on the GitHub page as well.
When using third-party managers such as Vortex or BG3MM, you'll probably run into more compatibility issues than you would with the in-game mod manager. Make sure to fully read the descriptions and FAQs on each mod page to make sure you didn't miss something.

How To Install A Mod Manager
How To Install Individual Mods
What To Know Before Installing
Mods heighten the gaming experience. You may want to play your first playthrough without any though, because once you start adding mods you won't be able to stop. Baldur's Gate 3 supports mods, so you will have no trouble customizing your gameplay experience.
RELATED:
Baldur'S Gate 3: The Best Mods
If you have never added mods to a game before or are a bit rusty from your Skyrim days, we have compiled instructions on how to add individual mods to Baldur's Gate 3. Once you know where to go, the rest is history.
How To Install A Mod Manager
The best thing about this game is that the main mod manager is supported. Using a mod manager makes installing mods one hundred times easier. With a manager like Vortex, you do not need to go into game files and do everything manually.
All you have to do is install a mod manager and the mods themselves, and the manager will do the rest. Baldur's Gate 3 mods can be found on NexusMods.com.
You can download the Vortex Mod Manager by Nexus Mods here.
Once you set up and launch the manager, you will have to click Games on the left side and find Baldur's Gate 3 among your list of games. Select ""Manage"" on the game cover to enable it for modding.
Download Vortex Mod Manager.
Set up the mod manager.
Enable Baldur's Gate 3.
Download mods.
How To Install Individual Mods
Since Vortex Mod Manager is supported, all you have to do is download a mod and NexusMods will send it straight to your Vortex Mod Manager for installation.
The mod manager will install the mod into Baldur's Gate 3 files automatically. You do not have to do anything once the website opens the mod into the manager for you.
Most Baldur's Gate 3 mods you find on Nexus Mods will support the Vortex Mod Manager, but some will still require a manual download.
How To Manually Download A Mod
When you select Manually Download on a mod file page, you will still need to use a mod manager, in this case the Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager instead of the Vortex one.
When you manually download a mod from Nexus Mods, inside the zip folder will be a couple of things. The items that end in ""pak"" are the mod files that must be transferred. Essentially, what you must do is transfer all the "".pak"" files into the mod folder within your game files.
Read More
What To Know Before Installing
Installing mods into any video game opens your game up to the risk of bugs and malfunction. The more support the game gives to modification, the less this is bound to happen.
When you open Baldur's Gate 3 after installing mods, the game will identify a change in files and inform you that there may be complications due to this change (mod installation). This is just a heads-up given to you if you didn't install mods or so that you understand why your file may have gotten corrupted.
You can simply ""Close"" the pop-up and continue as normal.
Another thing to note is that some mods require other mods or tools to be installed, in order for them to work correctly. For instance, the mod Tav's Hair Salon needs a specific Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager to be installed as well as Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Fixer in order to support the hair mod.
You can still download said mod without installing these extra tools, but the mod may not work in that case.

How to Get the Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit and Install Mods
Cody Perez
|
Published: Sept 5, 2024 10:00 pm GMT-4
With the release of Patch 7, developer Larian Studios has set up Baldur’s Gate 3 for its future. Though mods already existed in the game, it is now easier than ever to both install and even create mods for this incredible RPG. This system works because of the new Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit and the ability to install mods within the game.

How to Download and Use the Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit
The Toolkit is a new, separate application players can download for free on PC. If you want to pick up this free software yourself, head here. This program allows you to develop mods using the proprietary Larian Studios-created Osiris scripting language. Everything needed for mods is possible here from resolving build errors to basic debugging.
Perhaps the best and most important part of the Toolkit is you can upload the mods you make there to the BG3 servers themselves. This will make your mod officially available for players to download and install within the game client.
Image via Larian Studios
How to Install BG3 Mods Inside the Game
If you are like me and love installing mods but not necessarily making them, Patch 7 also includes some benefits for you as well. No longer do you have to go to external, third-party sites like Nexus Mods to find mods for your game. You can now install Baldur’s Gate 3 mods from within the game itself.
What you want to do is head to the main menu once you update to Patch 7 and you will see an in-game Mod Manager option now. This Mod Manager includes all of the mods that have been published through the Toolkit. You can instantly download and install these for your game. You can also freely enable and disable mods as you wish. This is especially nice for Steam Deck players like myself who don’t have to sift through the annoying folders.
Baldur’s Gate 3 is available right now for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

How to Prepare and Change Spells
BY EM STONHAM, BRANDON RAD, LYNETTE GUZMAN, +28 MORE

AUG 12, 2023

Characters are able to change spells outside of combat or when they level up. You might decide to change your spells if your party has a specific need for your journey or if you want to specialize roles for your party members (e.g., having a dedicated person for healing spells).
Who Can Prepare Spells
There are differences in how you can change spells based on your class.
Clerics, Druids, Paladins, and Wizards must prepare spells before they can use them. These classes can change prepared spells anytime when not in combat.
All other classes and subclasses who can learn spells are only able to replace a spell when leveling up. This includes Bards, Eldritch Knight Fighters, Rangers, Arcane Trickster Rogues, Sorcerers, and Warlocks. See more details in How to Change Spells During Level Up.
How to Prepare and Change Spells
ADVERTISEMENT
If you are a Cleric, Druid, Paladin, or Wizard, you can prepare and change spells at each level up or whenever you are not in combat.
To prepare spells at each level up, select ‘Prepare Spells’ on the left sidebar of your level-up screen. You have a certain number of spells you can prepare, based on your level. Remove any of your currently prepared spells to free up a spot and select from your list of Known Spells. (For mouse and keyboard, hover over a prepared spell and click on the red 'x' to remove it. For controller, highlight the prepared spell and select 'A' or the corresponding button to remove it.)
ADVERTISEMENT
To prepare your spells outside of combat, access your Spellbook by selecting ‘K’ on keyboard and mouse or by accessing your radial shortcut menu with right trigger on controller.
ADVERTISEMENT
NOTE: If you have a multiclass character, your spellbook will have different tabs for each class.
From here, you can remove prepared spells to swap out and prepare different spells. The number of spells you can prepare is based on your level.
How to Change Spells During Level Up
All spellcasting classes can change spells during each level up.
Clerics, Druids, Paladins, and Wizards can change their Prepared Spells by selecting from their Known Spells.
For all other spellcasting classes: You can replace one spell when leveling up your character. This option is available to you at every level up. You cannot replace Cantrips, only Spells that use a spell slot.
ADVERTISEMENT
On the left sidebar, go to ‘Replace Spell’ to access the menu. You’ll see a selection menu to choose one spell to change out and one spell to change in.
Select ‘Change’ under Out to choose a spell to remove from your list of available spells. Hit ‘Confirm’ and select ‘Change’ under In to choose the spell you would like to replace it with.
Respec to Change Spells
ADVERTISEMENT
Another option to change spells is by speaking with Withers to respec your character for 100 gold. This option is useful if you want to rebuild your character and make several changes at once.
You will start at Level 1 for your newly selected class and will be able to level up to your current character level. Check out our full guide to repec your character and how to find Withers!

Shdowheart is a great healer and addition to the player's party in BG3.
The player will certainly make use of spells during their playthrough of BG3, whether it’s through their character or one of their companions. Knowing how to change the character’s spells is essential as the player earns newer spells.
Spells In Baldur’s Gate 3
Spells are an important mechanic present in the Baldur’s Gate 3 world. They can be used to deal damage, heal, or cast other magical effects. Based on the character’s class and sometimes race, the spellcasting ability is decided. Typically, it is one of these three: Charisma, Wisdom, or Intelligence.
The very best classes for spellcasting are really the Wizard and the Sorcerer, however, most other classes can make use of spells nevertheless.
The player has the option to change their character’s spells, and here is how to achieve this:
Leveling Up
Your browser does not support the video tag.
The most obvious option the player has under their belt to change their character’s spells is to wait for leveling up. This is valid for all classes that can spellcast. This is especially easy to achieve early on as leveling up shouldn’t be too hard.
However, as the player advances, leveling up will take up more time and it won’t be a great option. Some classes do not have a choice and must just wait for leveling up, notably, Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Ranger, Eldritch Knight, and Arcane Trickster.
Prepare And Change The Spells
Your browser does not support the video tag.
Some classes are more lucky when it comes to changing spells. If desired, they can simply wait until their next level up, however, that’s not a must. The classes of Wizard, Cleric, Paladin, and Druid can prepare and change their spells outside of combat.
To do this, the player can choose the character that belongs to one of those classes and head over to Spellbook. This will open the menu to prepare and manage their spells.
When inside this menu, press on Prepare Spells. Here, the player will have the option to take out already equipped spells and choose new ones.
With this, the characters are ready for their next battle with the spells they will need. This allows for more customization based on what enemy the player is facing and makes it less stressful to pick spells during level-ups.
Baldur’s Gate 3 is now available to play on PC and PlayStation 5.
Baldur's Gate 3

Baldur's Gate 3 - How to Prepare & Change Spells
To optimize your party's abilities, you may need to manage and change spells.
Oct 3, 2023 1:04 PM
by
Ivan Valev
Larian Studios
Spells play a vital role in both combat and exploration in Baldur's Gate 3. To optimize your party's abilities, you may need to manage and change spells. In this guide, we'll walk you through the ins and outs of spell preparation and alteration in BG3.
When to Change Spells
Characters can change their spells outside of combat or during level-up. You might want to adjust your spells based on your party's needs or specialize your party members' roles (e.g., designating a healer).
Larian Studios
Who Can Prepare Spells
Spell management varies depending on your character's class:
Clerics, Druids, Paladins, and Wizards: They must prepare spells before using them. These classes can change prepared spells anytime outside of combat.
Other Spellcasting Classes: Classes like Bards, Eldritch Knight Fighters, Rangers, Arcane Trickster Rogues, Sorcerers, and Warlocks can only replace a spell when leveling up. This applies to all subclasses as well.
How to Prepare and Change Spells
If you fall under the category of Cleric, Druid, Paladin, or Wizard, you can prepare and change spells during each level-up or when not in combat.
Preparing Spells at Level-Up: Click on 'Prepare Spells' on the left sidebar of your level-up screen. You can prepare a certain number of spells based on your level. Remove any currently prepared spells to free up space and choose from your list of Known Spells.
Larian Studios
Preparing Spells Outside of Combat: Access your Spellbook by pressing 'K' on the keyboard or mouse or using the radial shortcut menu with the right trigger on the controller. From here, you can remove prepared spells to swap them with different ones. The number of spells you can prepare depends on your level.
Larian Studios
How to Change Spells During Level-Up
All spellcasting classes can change spells during level-ups.
For Clerics, Druids, Paladins, and Wizards: You can change your Prepared Spells by selecting from your Known Spells.
For Other Spellcasting Classes: You can replace one spell when leveling up. This option is available at every level-up. You cannot replace Cantrips, only Spells that use a spell slot. Go to 'Replace Spell' on the left sidebar, choose one spell to change out and one to change in. Select 'Change' under 'Out' to remove a spell and 'Change' under 'In' to replace it.
Respec to Change Spells
If you want to make significant changes to your character's build, you can speak with Withers to respec your character for 100 gold. This option allows you to rebuild your character and make multiple changes at once. Your character will start at Level 1 for your newly selected class and can level up to your current character level. Check out our comprehensive guide on how to respec your character and locate Withers!

Several classes in Baldur's Gate 3 allow your character to equip and cast spells, which offer a huge variety of effects that could provide powerful effects in battle or utility when outside of conflict. Whether you are preparing magic or picking from known spells, quickly accessing magic can be a bit tricky. Depending on your build, the number of spell slots at your disposal could be a select few or a high amount.
The Bard, Warlock, and Sorcerer class in Baldur's Gate 3 always have all their known spells prepared and ready to use. On the other hand, the Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger, and Wizard classes have to prepare a limited number of spells based on your character's level. The higher levels you reach with your build, the more spells you can choose to have prepared of larger, more powerful slots.

How To Level Up Fast In Baldur’S Gate 3
How to Equip Spells in Baldur's Gate 3
The number of spells in Baldur's Gate 3 you can have equipped depends on how many your class can know or prepare, and may be placed into your action bar from your Character Sheet. Characters that use spells known recharge known magic, but prepared magic users have a chance to rearrange the spells they have on hand. New spells can be included in your Spellbook once your character levels up.
Cantrips are non-leveled spells that appear on your action bar the most when equipping spells, since they do not require slots to cast in any situation.
Traveling to the Character Sheet of you or any of your companions in Baldur's Gate 3 lets you adjust their spells from the Spellbook section on the far right. While the exact number of spells you can have on hand will depend on your class and level, the game will have small blue boxes next to level 1 or higher spells. The number of boxes determines how many spells of that level you may have equipped at any given time.
If your character can cast spells above the 1st level, it automatically gets prepared at higher levels without contributing to the boxes. For example, Shadowheart can have the Bless spell at 1st level, but when she gains 2nd level slots, the level 2 variant of Bless is added to your action bar. This continues at even higher levels, so keep track of the variety of spells you can equip in Baldur's Gate 3.

Baldur's Gate 3 lets you respec your characters, including origin characters and other companions. Here's how.

In Baldur's Gate 3 if you want to respec your character, or respec origin characters or any other companions, there's only one guy who can do it for you. His name is Withers, and he's a spooky but friendly undead dude who will hang out at your camp providing respec services in exchange for gold.
Finding Withers isn't exactly easy, but it can be done very early on in Baldur's Gate 3, and it's well worth it to recruit him as soon as possible. As a bonus, Withers can also revive dead companions or provide hirelings for a fee.
Letting you respec is probably the most important function Withers can provide. Who hasn't built a character and then decided later that they want to try something else without starting the game over from scratch? Or maybe you just want to tinker with the abilities and skills of other members of your party? Here's how to respec your character and companions in Baldur's Gate 3.

Be level 2 or 3
Have at least 2 companions
Have lockpicks
Have a trap disarming kit
First, you'll need to track down Withers. He's in the Dank Crypt close to where you begin the game after the ship crashes. From the shipwreck, just head north along the Ravaged Beach until you find the spot where Shadowheart is trying to open an ancient door.
You'll need lockpicks and luck: there's a DC 20 sleight of hand check to open this lock. If you keep failing or don't have lockpicks, there are other ways into the crypt, though they're a lot more dangerous. We'll cover those entrances further down this page.
Finding Withers in the Dank Crypt
(Image credit: Larian Studios)
If you've come in through the ancient door, you'll see two chambers ahead. Be careful in the first one. It's got two traps: gas vents on the floor and a fire trap on the walls. The traps will be activated if you open the sarcophagus in the middle of the room. Successful perception rolls will reveal the vents (which can be disarmed if you have a trap disarming kit) and a button on the pillar to your right that will shut off the traps.

Even if you set off the traps, you should have time to grab the loot from the sarcophagus in the middle of the room (it contains a key) and then run into the next chamber (in turn-based mode). In the first round the grease will come from the vents, but the flames won't start until the second round.
Through the large oak doors to the north you'll enter another, larger crypt with a statue against the far wall. You'll also see some corpses lying around—loot them before you do anything else because they're about to come back to life. On the northwest side of the statue a perception check will reveal a button. When pushed it'll open a secret door leading to Withers' sarcophagus. (And it'll animate those corpses. If you looted them, they'll be a bit easier to fight. You can loot them again after, and they'll suddenly have gold in their pockets.)
How to bring Withers to your camp
(Image credit: Larian Studios)
To recruit Withers, you'll just have to have a quick chat with him. He'll ask you a question about life and death, and then he'll bounce. (Don't forget to loot his sarcophagus.) You'll see Withers again as soon as you make camp, when he'll be chilling out by the boat along the water.
To respec your custom character, an origin character, or any companion, just speak to Withers. Tell him you want to change your class and for 100 gold you'll be taken to the character creation screen. Note: you can't change your looks here, just your class and distribution of your ability points.
Once you've changed class, you'll be level one again and can level up immediately. If you change an origin character's class the story will ignore the fact Karlach is now a wizard, but you'll know better.
Other entrances to the Dank Crypt
(Image credit: Larian Studios)
Chapel Entrance: If the lock on the ancient door isn't working out, then head to the chapel entrance, which you'll find up the hill to the north and west of the ancient door. At the chapel entrance you'll encounter several bandits (you can fight them or intimidate them into leaving). There's also a patch of stone floor that's crumbling near a statue. If you walk over that part of the floor, it'll break, dropping your party into the refectory below. You can also shoot the rope holding the up the stone above it, which is handy in the fight.
Just outside the chamber you land in is a large party of bandits you'll have to fight (take advantage of the doorway into the room, which is a nice bottleneck). There's also a locked door with no handle or lock. Once you've defeated the bandits, head through the refectory until you find another statue. Behind it on the wall is a skull that is actually a lever. It'll open the locked door in the first chamber. From there, you can proceed into the Dank Crypt.
Wooden Hatch: If you continue past the chapel entrance you'll find a narrow path along the coast, overlooking the beach. Follow that path north and you'll find a hatch. Picking the lock will take you into the Dank Crypt.

Baldur's Gate 3 has a dozen classes for you to try out. Each one offers unique capabilities in combat, as well as some functions when you're exploring. However, you don't need to get stuck with your choice at the start of the game. Our guide discusses how you can respec and change classes in Baldur's Gate 3.
How to Respec and Change Class in Baldur's Gate 3
To respec and change your class in Baldur's Gate 3, you need to meet with Withers, the undead skeletal figure in the Dank Crypt. The location can be visited early on during the game's first act. Once your character wakes up on the beach, you'll find a large set of double doors next to the Overgrown Ruins waypoint. You can either lockpick that, or head to the top of the cliffs to reach the alternate entrance (but watch out for the bandits).
Once inside, beware of traps and more enemies. Then, once you've discovered the ornate sarcophagus, open it to make Withers appear. He'll ask you a question and, after your response, he'll head to your Camp. Once there, select a character who needs to respec and talk to Withers. You need 100 gold to make use of this function.
Pay Withers 100 gold to change your class.
Additional Tips When You Respec or Change Class
The Baldur's Gate 3 respec and change class mechanic can be used by your main character, as well as all companions. For instance, maybe you want Gale to be a Barbarian instead of a Wizard. Meanwhile, Lae'zel and Karlach could turn into a Paladin and Sorcerer, respectively.
This can also be helpful once you've recruited characters like Halsin and Jaheira. Since both of them are Druids, you probably want one of them to switch to a different class.
Jaheira and Halsin are both Druids but, let's face it, do you really need two Druids in your team?
Moreover, this mechanic complements the multiclass feature. With it, you can add levels to another class, obtaining its spells or actions for that particular rank. And, last but not least, Withers himself is also the same NPC that you can talk to if you want to get Hirelings.
Baldur's Gate 3 is filled to the brim with activities and secrets. You'll no doubt be part of an adventure that can take countless hours to complete. For other tips, you can visit our BG3 guides hub.

Where To Find Withers – The BG3 Change Stats NPC
How To Reset BG3 Class & Stats
It's no secret that Baldur's Gate 3 is an absolutely massive game, filled with permutations that promise to make every playthrough unique. It's easy to get bored with a build after a few dozen hours of gameplay – thankfully, respeccing in BG3 is very forgiving and cheap, once players have actually unlocked this mechanic.
RELATED:
Baldur'S Gate 3: How To Get To Underdark (& All Entrances)
The Baldur's Gate 3 respec NPC is found very early into Act 1 and can be unlocked before players ever reach the Druid Grove. This NPC is able to completely reset a character – or companion – from Level 1, and can even change players' Class as part of the deal. After beating the tutorial area aboard the Nautiloid, the ability to respec is just a catacomb away.
Updated September 16, 2023 by Erik Petrovich: The BG3 reset class mechanic is pretty easy to locate, and is found right at the start of the game. Though players likely won't have a use for the services of the Baldur's Gate 3 reset NPC until later on, it's worth unlocking as early as possible in case you make mistakes while leveling up. Plus, by unlocking the ability to change stats Baldur's Gate 3 players also are able to continue the questlines of some Act 2 characters, including Arabelle, whose stories are tied to the BG3 respec NPC Withers. This guide has been updated to more clearly explain the directions and requirements for the BG3 reset mechanic, to clarify some information that changed with the full release, and to more simply explain how to find the change class NPC in the first place.
Where To Find Withers – The BG3 Change Stats NPC
Find the Dank Crypt in the Overgrown Ruins' Chapel
In Act 1 players will come across a locked door north of the game's starting point on the beach. Shadowheart will appear here if she was not interacted with on the Nautiloid. This is one of two entrances to the Dank Crypt beneath the Overgrown Ruins, but requires players to both lockpick the door and keenly avoid traps within to reach its innermost Crypts.
It's perfectly possible, especially if players go out of the way to pick up Astarion first, but the more convenient (and less trapped) entrance can be found above. Travel east to the coast from where Lae'zel shows up, just north of Gale's introductory waypoint, to find the top part of the Overgrown Ruins.
Be sure to first gather a full party, then either kill the party of bandits or convince them to leave before heading downward. Progress through the labyrinthian crypts below, and defeat other bandits who didn't get the memo to leave, to find the Dank Crypt. The Dank Crypt is full of ""dead"" undead around a central alcove, hidden behind a Button that is revealed by a Passive Perception check when walking by. Pressing this button opens up the alcove's entrance, but also triggers the undead to rise around the room, initiating combat with the small group of skeletal mages and warriors.
Defeat Undead, Answer Withers' Question, Then Return to Camp
The encounter with the undead isn't difficult, but it is a fight made much easier by pre-emptively placing companions around the room to gain the advantage on the freshly-risen undead. Separate the party, then place each party member in different spots around the room. Having everyone spread out is a good way to keep enemies from focusing their fire on a single ally, and prevents AoE attacks from being too devastating, too.
RELATED:
Baldur'S Gate 3: How To Get To Act 2
Once all party members are in position, preferably close to a skeleton that will come back to life, press the hidden Button and complete the combat encounter. The button opens a smaller alcove within the Dank Crypt, containing a chest and what appears to be a sealed sarcophagus. Interact with the sarcophagus to find Withers, the BG3 respec character NPC, who rises out of the coffin and speaks to the player.
Withers will ask the player what the worth of a life is. Respond to this question (any answer will do), then complete the dialogue. Withers will walk away to tend to the Dank Crypt, but he will appear at camp the next time you go for a Long Rest. For the rest of Baldur's Gate 3 Withers will remain here, ready to offer his services.
How To Reset BG3 Class & Stats
When it comes to the question of whether players can respec class Baldur's Gate 3 answers not only ""yes,"" but also makes it very convenient. Not only is it affordable, but it's also comprehensive, able to completely reset a character from the ground up – including Stats, Feats, Subclass, and even Class should one choose. No quests or progress is otherwise reset, though some companion storylines may not make sense if their class is changed.
RELATED:
Every Background In Baldur'S Gate 3, Ranked
Withers currently has two unique abilities that make him invaluable to all BG3 parties: the ability to revive dead companions, and the ability to reset players' and companions' builds from scratch. Withers also plays a part in some questlines, and players eventually put the pieces together to discover more about the truth of what he is. But in BG3, to respec characters, all players need to do is talk to Withers and have a bit of spare change.
Withers asks for a mere 100 gold to change class in Baldur's Gate 3, an amount that can be earned by just selling a few unused Scrolls, Equipment, or Alchemical Ingredients. After confirming the choice, the target character will reset to Level 1 and enter a Class Selection screen.
If you want to just re-spec a character, simply select the same Class (and Subclass, if applicable) from this initial menu. After confirming and closing Class Selection, players will have a Level 1 version of their character, with all the skill, stat, and other adjustments made at the initial screen. Now, by following the normal process to level up, players are able to make new choices at every level up to the point they were at before respeccing. So, a Level 8 character that uses this service can go back and make new choices at every level without losing XP.
The only thing that's lost when restarting from scratch is that pesky 100 gold, making it very cheap to respec Baldur's Gate 3 characters – and Withers doesn't mind if you pickpocket all the money back, anyway.
Baldur's Gate 3 is available for PC and PlayStation 5. A version for Xbox Series X/S is currently in development.

Where to Find and Recruit Minthara
BY EM STONHAM, BRANDON RAD, LYNETTE GUZMAN, +28 MORE
UPDATED
JAN 11, 2024
One of the most interesting things about Baldur's Gate 3 is the absolute freedom of choice that it gives players - and the consequences that follow each and every choice.
ADVERTISEMENT
Building your dream party can take a little effort, and one of the most popular (but hard to obtain) party members is Minthara. Before the Patch 5 update, getting her on your side either required an entirely Chaotic Evil run of the game or a convoluted mess involving Polymorph abilities.
Thankfully, it's now a lot easier to find and recruit Minthara without the need for utter carnage. The steps for this recruitment are still somewhat fiddly, though, so make sure you follow the steps given exactly. Here, you'll find IGN's complete Walkthrough for unlocking Minthara as an ally during a Good/Neutral run of BG3, including her location and which Rolls to look out for.

How to Recruit Minthara In Baldur's Gate 3
ADVERTISEMENT
Minthara is a Drow Paladin who starts off as one of the leaders of the Goblin Army.
The first time that players will meet her is during the questline that involves rescuing Halsin from the Goblins. The majority of players do end up killing her on their first playthrough, but with some careful planning, it's possible to have her on your side - and even romance her if you choose.
To get to that point, though, you'll need to be in the Goblin Camp and working through the battles with the various Goblin leaders. When you get to Minthara, make sure you enable 'Non-Lethal' attacks. If you miss this step, you won't be able to recruit her.
Your aim here will be to knock Minthara unconscious, but it's important to meet a specific requirement before doing this.
Minthara must have the temporary Hostile status before you knock her out. You can achieve this by attacking her without Halsin being visible or by stealing something in front of her then attacking her, but make sure you do this after promising to help her clear out the Grove.
If you've done this correctly, knocking Minthara out will leave her as a lootable body but still alive. This will meet the requirements for the Halsin questline and tell the game that you've cleared out the Goblin Camp even though she's still alive.
ADVERTISEMENT
If you're worried you haven't done it right, leave the room and take a Long Rest before clearing out the rest of the camp. Walk back in to double check. If she is standing up as normal, you'll need to rinse and repeat so that she ends up knocked unconscious after being Hostile.
Finish up the Goblin Camp ques tline and continue heading on your way to Moonrise Towers. It doesn't matter if you head there via the Underdark or the Mountain Pass.
Follow the Act Two quest along until you end up in Moonrise Towers under the guise of being a True Soul.
ADVERTISEMENT
Here, you'll encounter Minthara being interrogated by her commanders - Ketheric and Z'rell - about the location of the Artifact.
It's worth saving here. There are a number of important Rolls coming up that you'll need to pass in order to recruit Minthara.
You'll need to speak to the commanders and pass multiple Wisdom Rolls in order to convince them that they should throw Minthara into jail and spare her life.
When Minthara is thrown into jail, follow after her. You'll be able to follow a trail of blood to the Interrogation Chamber where Minthara is being held.
When you find Minthara, she will be having her memories erased by the two Questioners. It's a gruesome and painful process.
You've got two choices here- either you can convince the guards to leave her alone and let you take over, or you can just choose to attack them. Make this choice based on your party's strengths and Charisma stats.
ADVERTISEMENT
Either way is fine for the unlock process, though.
You'll need to either talk your way out of Moonrise Towers or fight your way out. The important thing to note is that you can't Fast Travel here- if you do, Minthara will be left behind. Make sure you walk out of the gates with Minthara.
With the right Charisma Rolls, Minthara will ask to meet you at camp.
ADVERTISEMENT
Then, head back to camp and save your game.
From here, you'll be able to interact with Minthara and have her join your party just like any other companion character. You can give her her gear back, speak to her, romance her, or swap her out for other party members.
With that, you've officially recruited Minthara! At this point in the story, it's a good time to start preparing for Act Three and finishing up some side quests for extra experience and gear. There's still a lot left to finish in BG3, so your party will need all the help they can get.

How To Recruit Minthara In Baldur’s Gate 3 (Patch 5)
Should You Recruit Minthara In Baldur’s Gate 3?
Thanks to Patch 5, good-aligned Baldur’s Gate 3 players can now officially recruit Minthara as a companion, allowing her to join the party on their quests. The evil Drow Paladin was previously only recruitable if players raided the Emerald Grove in Act One, effectively locking out good-aligned characters from experiencing her story.
Before Patch 5, good-aligned players had to rely on workarounds to recruit Minthara. Players quickly resorted to using mods or an extraordinarily technical loophole involving Polymorph to transform her into a sheep. Furthermore, it was briefly possible to recruit Halsin and Minthara together in the same playthrough, but this has since been patched out.
How To Recruit Minthara In Baldur’s Gate 3 (Patch 5)
Recruit Minthara Without The Use of Mods
According to Larian’s patch notes, Minthara will reappear at Moonrise Towers in Act 2 if she is simply knocked out in Act 1 and not killed. To knock her out, you’ll have to toggle on your party’s non-lethal attacks before fighting her. This option can be toggled under the Passives tab on your Hotbar.
RELATED
Baldur's Gate 3 Player Accidentally Discovers Rare Minthara Moment
Minthara will typically refuse to go back to Act 1 with the player, but using this Baldur's Gate 3 trick players can unlock this rare dialogue option.
However, community testing has also revealed a few additional requirements that you’ll need to be mindful of. Primarily, Minthara must be Temporarily Hostile rather than permanently hostile. To trigger this state, simply commit a crime in front of her to start a fight. Once she is temporarily hostile, knock her out so you can proceed with the rest of the events without her being affected. This must be done at the Goblin Camp in Baldur's Gate 3, not the Emerald Grove.
Dror Ragzlin, another of the Goblin Camp’s leaders, must still be alive and non-hostile when you knock out Minthara. If fought, Ragzlin will alert the whole Goblin Camp, making them permanently hostile, including Minthara. Perhaps create a save before progressing, just in case things go south.
Once you’ve knocked Minthara out cold, you can continue as normal and proceed into Act 2 of Baldur's Gate 3. Once you reach Moonrise Towers for the first time during Act 2, a cutscene will play where Minthara is judged and imprisoned by Ketheric Thorm. This unlocks Decide Minthara’s Fate, a side quest that allows you to break her out of Moonrise Towers Prison. Once you've freed her, she can be spoken to and recruited to the party.
If you’re still having trouble, YouTuber Crimsomrider has a great outline of the recruitment process in their video.
Make sure to rescue Minthara and the tieflings (and potentially Wulbren, too) before entering Baldur’s Gate 3’s Gauntlet of Shar. The Gauntlet contains a point of no return, locking you out of certain incomplete side quests and potentially killing any prisoners locked up in Moonrise Towers.
Should You Recruit Minthara In Baldur’s Gate 3?
Minthara Isn't Ideal For Morally Good Playthroughs
While technically doable, Minthara’s recruitment method for a good run doesn’t seem quite feature-complete, as she is still clearly ideal for a morally corrupt playthrough, with her character feeling more natural in this setting. Especially given that Halsin and Minthara can no longer be recruited together, it's hard to argue for Minthara in a good-natured playthrough since Halsin is a better companion for this version despite not being one of the best overall.
RELATED
Is Minthara Worth Recruiting In Baldur's Gate 3?
Recruiting Minthara in Baldur’s Gate 3 forces you to make morally evil decisions. Is she worth the sacrifices required to bring her into the party?
As for evil-aligned characters, Minthara can still be recruited in the same way as before, by simply siding with her and aligning with her preferences. As an evil character, Minthara differs from other party members in Baldur's Gate 3. As the only Drow companion in the game, she brings a unique perspective that no one else (except a Drow Tav or Dark Urge) has. She’s also classed as a Paladin, making her a valuable addition to your Baldur’s Gate 3 party if you don’t already have a Paladin’s might on your side.

Baldur’s Gate 3 Minthara companion guide
Minthara is a powerful ally in Baldur’s Gate 3, but she can come at a cost. Here's how to recruit the Drow, both violently and non.
Lowell Bell
Published: 11 months ago
Baldur's Gate 3 
How do you recruit Minthara in BG3? Minthara is a potential companion that most players will not recruit due to the complexity, or cruelty, required to get her to join your party. As a Drow Paladin, however, she can make a valuable ally. Combining both melee prowess and healing abilities earned from her deity, she can tank hits while keeping herself and your party – those that stick around after you recruit her, that is – alive.
If you still plan on adding Minthara to your Baldur’s Gate 3 party, check out our BG3 classes guide so you know how to outfit the rest of your party – complimentary classes are the best way forward. BG3 Minthara herself is a Lolth-Sworn Drow, which means she’s a tad more evil than her Seldarine cousins. If all that sounds like demonic language to you, our guide on the many Baldur’s Gate 3 races and their numerous subraces has you covered. With all that knowledge under your belt, you’re ready to find out what Minthara can bring to your BG3 party.
How to recruit Minthara
Upon reaching the Goblin Camp in Act 1, you can access the Shattered Sanctum. Find Minthara planning to attack Druid Grove here and tell her the location of Druid Grove, gaining her trust and betraying the Druids and Tieflings there. After slaughtering everyone at Emerald Grove, you have the option to recruit Minthara to your party after your next long rest.
You must not free Halsin in the Warg Pens in Druid Grove, as that makes all NPCs in the area hostile to you – including Minthara. Recruiting Minthara causes Wyll and Karlach to refuse to join your party, and you cannot recruit Halsin at all. Make your choice.
How to recruit Minthara without murdering everyone
If you don’t want to turn on the Druids and allow the goblins to decimate their camp but still want Minthara by your side, there is a way. When you reach the Shattered Sanctum, head right and find Minthara. Attack her, but ensure that your non-lethal passive is enabled, this way, you can defeat Minthara and complete your quest, but she’ll still be alive to recruit later.
In Act 2, when you reach Moonrise Towers, you’ll find that Minthara is being lambasted by her superiors, and on the verge of execution as she’s questioned about Shadowheart’s artifact. If you can pass the required rolls, Minthara’s life will be spared, and she will be thrown in jail instead.
Once Minthara is taken away, you can follow her down into the jail, where you will find her being tortured. Either convince her torturers to leave or kill them, at which point Minthara will temporarily join you. Escape Moonrise Towers without fast traveling, and Minthara will join you in camp.
Minthara abilities, starting equipment, and skills
Minthara has quite high stats with a focus on strength – no surprise there. With high charisma as well, she has great defenses against impairment spells and can sling them, too.
Here are Minthara’s stats:
Strength: 17
Dexterity: 12
Constitution: 13
Intelligence: 8
Wisdom: 10
Charisma: 15
Minthara starts with proficiency in the following Baldur’s Gate 3 skills: Athletics, History, Perception, Intimidation, and Persuasion.
Minthara’s starting equipment:
Boots of Striding
Ring Mail Armor
Simple Boots
Studded Shield
Xyanyde (Simple melee weapon)
How to complete Minthara’s companion quest
The process of recruiting Minthara acts as her companion quest – from assaulting Druid Grove to saving her from Moonrise tower, you’ve already gone through quite the ordeal by the time she joins your party.
How to gain Minthara’s approval
Minthara isn’t a good person. We know that already, what with the whole ‘attack Druid Grove’ thing. Anything you do that may be seen as advantageous for the Absolute will gain Minthara’s approval.
How to romance Minthara
At your camp, speak with her and tell her that you are hers; she will agree to meet you after everyone settles for the evening. Return to your bedroll and select Minthara as your companion for the evening to trigger the romance scene. You will then awaken to her standing over you with a dagger poised to end your life. You must persuade her or convince her to not attack. Otherwise, you will have to fight her in your camp. What a lovely romantic partner.
Best Minthara build
Taking our best paladin build guide as a base, this is the ideal skill progression for a paladin:
Level 2
Defence
Level 3
Durable
Level 8
Tough
Level 12
Shield Master
Minthara is a perfect companion if you wish to pursue the BG3 Dark Urge origin during character creation; otherwise, tread lightly if you want this powerful Drow to join your team. Read our guide on Baldur’s Gate 3 Halsin to see if he’s a better character for you, and take a gander at our BG3 Wyll guide as he doesn’t particularly take kindly to the atrocities that Minthara wishes to commit. If those guides still don’t dissuade you from pursuing Minthara, best to sleep with one eye open.

Where To Find The Owlbear Cub In The Goblin Camp
How To Get The Owlbear To Come To Your Camp
Although Baldur's Gate 3 has an interesting cast of companions, none are quite as fearsome and adorable as the owlbear cub. Unfortunately, getting the cub takes some effort and a lot of time, but adding the mystical owlbear to your camp is entirely worth it.

The half-bear, half-owl creatures were some of the earliest monsters in Dungeons & Dragons, first appearing in its supplementary rulebook, Greyhawk. However, owlbears no longer need to be feared (well, you can still fear them a bit), as one of their cubs can now be added to your camp in Baldur's Gate 3.
Updated January 13, 2023: Everyone loves the owlbear cub! We've added some more details on this little mini-quest to make sure everyone has the best chance of recruiting this loyal companion.
How To Find The Owlbear Nest
An owlbear and its cub can be found in a cave between the Druid Grove and the Blighted Village, just north of the bridge and close to where you'll find Scratch the dog.
Once you get close enough, a cutscene will begin, and you will be able to either use Animal Handling to study the owlbear's behaviour, back away by passing a Survival check, puff out your chest and roar by passing a Performance check, or attack.
If you convinced Brynna and Andrick to enter the Owlbear Nest to take revenge on the creature for killing Edowin, they'll be waiting for you inside the cave. Talking to them will provoke them to attack the creature - if this happens, you'll be drawn into the battle. Don't worry, as you can still recruit the owlbear cub as long as it doesn't die in this battle.
Do be wary, though, as the cultists will target the cub and might kill it before the end of the fight (which occurs immediately after defeating the Owlbear and, if playing on Honour Mode, its mate).
Passing the Animal Handling check will expose the owlbear cub, which the owlbear is clearly protecting.
You can then either hold out your hands to show it you mean no harm, move toward it, back away slowly, or attack. It should be noted that any failed checks or hostile behaviour will lead to the owlbear attacking you and your party. Otherwise, the owlbear will allow you to leave the cave.
You can also talk to the owlbear if you have a means of Speaking to Animals. The options remain largely the same, though. You cannot approach the Owlbear without starting a fight.
Walking away and leaving the owlbear alive with its cub will still allow you to encounter the cub again and add it to your camp. However, if you'd still like to take out the owlbear, you can attack it without endangering the cub. The battle will end as soon as the mother owlbear is dead.
If you take the violent route and kill the owlbear mother, make sure you interact with the owlbear cub afterwards and refrain from killing it.
You can also loot the Owlbear to get the Head of a Broken Spear, which can be combined with the Shaft of a Broken Spear, which is found on Edowin's body. Also, don't forget to check the nearby skeleton for the Oak Father's Embrace armor.
There is also an Owlbear Egg at the back of the cave! While this isn't going to hatch into a second Owlbear cub, you can try to pass it off as a Githyanki Egg in a future side quest.
Where To Find The Owlbear Cub In The Goblin Camp
After the encounter in the cave, you will be able to find the owlbear cub at the Goblin Camp, which is located west of the Druid Grove and Blighted Village. The cub can be found near the entrance to the camp, surrounded by goblins. Once you spot it, interacting with the cub will lead to a discussion with a goblin named Krolla, who will introduce you to a new and terrible sport called Chicken-Chasing.
Though Krolla will begin explaining the rules to you, she will eventually tell you to ""come back when that halfwit's done wailin'."" This is referring to Volo the Bard, who appears to be captured by the goblins and is standing on a pedestal in the middle of the camp. Once you've spoken to him, you can return to Krolla to find out more about Chicken-Chasing.
You can also speak to the owlbear cub and show it that you aren't going to harm it by passing two Animal Handling checks. However, it will ultimately tell you to deal with the goblins before it can follow your scent to camp.
How To Get The Owlbear To Come To Your Camp
Now, there are three different routes you can take to get the owlbear cub. Firstly, it is important to interact with the cub and let it smell your hands - this is how it makes its way to your camp.
Save yourself some time and denounce Chicken-Chasing as the cruel sport it is.
Partake in a game and earn some extra gold.
Slaughter the goblins outside. As long as there are no goblins keeping the owlbear cub captive, and he knows your scent, he'll be yours.
For the first and quickest route, you can condemn Chicken-Chasing altogether. Simply go back to Krolla, tell her you can't remember the rules, and then say that you don't want to play the game because it's cruel. The conversation will end there, and you talk to Krolla again and tell her that the cub is coming with you.
Here, you'll have to either intimidate, persuade, buy the cub for 500 gold, or use your Illithid wisdom. The easiest option is to use your Illithid powers, which will convince Krolla that you're a True Soul and prompt her to provide you with the cub as a gift.
For the second route, you can play a round of Chicken-Chasing for 30 gold or wager 75 gold if you're feeling confident. After that, the owlbear cub will run to the pen, where the game will take place.
In order to ensure that you'll win, you can interact with the owlbear cub and either pass an Animal Handling check to encourage it to run through the posts or Persuade it to attack the goblins. When the game begins, you'll have to chase the owlbear cub between the posts − be sure to mind the grease, though.
Once you've won, you can talk to Krolla to claim your wager. Though she'll conveniently tell you that Chicken-Chasing can only be won by goblins, you can Intimidate or Persuade her to give you your earnings. After that, you can speak to her again to tell her that the owlbear cub is coming with you, which will lead to the same options as the first route of Persuading, Intimidating, buying the cub, or using your Illithid wisdom.
Regardless of the route you take, the cub will disappear and reappear at your camp a few nights later. If the cub doesn't arrive immediately, you may need to progress the story a little.
Once he's joined your camp, you can interact with the owlbear cub every time you head there to rest. You can pet him and even speak to him if you have a way of speaking with animals. If you also have Scratch at your camp, you can experience a cutscene in which you pet both of them at the same time, netting you the You Have Two Hands For A Reason achievement.

Baldur's Gate 3 - How to Respec (Find Withers)
Where to Find the Owlbear Nest in BG3
Find the owlbear cub and its mother for the first time in the Owlbear Cave, which is located northeast of the Blighted Village waypoint. One path to get there is to head west from the Emerald Grove Envions waypoint, cross the bridge and turn right to follow the path down until you reach the Cave Mouth.
ADVERTISEMENT
Enter the cave. The path to the left will lead you to the Gilded Chest of Selûne, but taking the path straight ahead will lead you to an owlbear and its cub.
TIP: Use a character that either has Speak With Animals or a character who is likely to succeed on an Animal Handling skill check whenever speaking to the owlbear or its cub.
The owlbear mother will approach, wanting to feed you to her cub. You can move through the dialogue options and either persuade the owlbear to let you leave or engage in a fight.
Should You Kill the Owlbear in BG3?
If you successfully convince the owlbear that you’re not a threat, you will be free to go. But if you get too close to the owlbear or its stash, you will trigger combat.
You do not need to fight the owlbear to get the owlbear cub. As long as you have a first interaction with the owlbear mother, you will be able to find the cub again and recruit it to your camp. Jump to Free the Owlbear at the Goblin Camp to learn more.
ADVERTISEMENT
Combat will end after you kill the owlbear mother. You will have a cutscene that gives you a choice to either let the owlbear cub live or attack it.
Choose ""Let the creature live"" if you want it in your camp. The owlbear cub will feast, and you’ll be able to loot anything in the cave.
Free the Owlbear at the Goblin Camp
ADVERTISEMENT
After finding the owlbear cave, find the Goblin Camp on your quest to Rescue the First Druid Halsin.
As you enter the front gates, you’ll find Volo held captive on stage in front of an audience of goblins. To the left of the stage is the owlbear cub near a cluster of goblins.
NOTE: If you do not see the owlbear cub in the goblin camp, you may need to take a long rest one or two times before it will appear.
Speak with Krolla, and she will explain chicken-chasin’ and ask if you would like to try it. The goblins believe the owlbear cub is a chicken and have a game where you can chase it through the obstacle course.
You can choose to play (and pay gold) or decline - either option will allow you to have a private conversation with the owlbear cub. After finishing the conversation with Krolla, speak with the owlbear cub. You will be able to invite the owlbear cub to your camp.
ADVERTISEMENT
Speak to Krolla again. You will now have the option to tell her, ""I'm leaving - and the owlbear's coming with me.""
After selecting that option, you will be able to perform a skill check, offer to purchase the owlbear cub, or use your Illithid powers to convince her to free it.
ADVERTISEMENT
Once you succeed, the owlbear cub will run off to follow your scent to camp.
How to Get the Owlbear Cub in Your Camp
It will take a few days for the owlbear you rescued to follow your scent back to camp. Continue taking long rests during your journey and the owlbear cub will appear in a cutscene.
TIP: The character who initiates the long rest will be the one who interacts with the owlbear cub. If you want to understand what the owlbear is saying, use a character who has Speak With Animals. Any character can gain the owlbear cub’s trust, though.
You’ll have the option to give the cub a piece of food or make an Animal Handling check to beckon him closer. The cub will be hesitant, but it is also hungry and will want to eat food.
ADVERTISEMENT
On this first visit to camp, the owlbear cub will get scared and flee. For example, if you have Karlach in your party, she will loudly proclaim her cuteness aggression and unintentionally scare the owlbear cub.
The owlbear cub will appear again at your camp when you take the next long rest. This time, it is hurt.
ADVERTISEMENT
Help the cub by tending to its wounds and continue selecting positive choices in your interaction.
The owlbear cub will now stay at your camp. You can now give it as many pets as you'd like!
Also, if you have a party member with the Outlander background (e.g., Karlach), then they will earn an Inspiration point.

Finding the Owlbear Cub in your campsite
Can you get the Owlbear as a companion?
The Baldur's Gate 3 Owlbear Cub is one of the cutest creatures in the game, but you can get it to come back to your camp and join the party? Fortunately... yes! The owlbear can be recruited as a pet/ally, and while it's not quite a companion on the level with the others, finding the nest and the creature's mother starts a little chain of events that can have impact all the way to the very end of the game. With that in mind, here's how to get the Owlbear Cub to join your camp and be a furry, feathered pet throughout Baldur's Gate 3.
How to get the Owlbear in Baldur's Gate 3
(Image: © Larian Studios)
1. Find the Owlbear and its cub in the Nest, Northeast of the Blighted Village. If you fail the Animal Handling skill check, or if you fail to intimidate the Owlbear mother with your roar, you will instigate a fight to the death and be forced to kill the Owlbear mother.
2. Killing the Owlbear mother in Baldur's Gate 3 results in a choice: kill the cub and end its suffering, or spare it. If you want to recruit it, obviously you need to let it live. However, even if you walk away and the mother lives, it will be killed by goblins.
4. The owlbear cub is captured by goblins and will next show up at the goblin camp, on the left when you go through the main bridge entrance. You can buy it from the goblins or negotiate its freedom. It will flee when you do.
3. A few days later, the Owlbear cub will show up at camp, hungry. Feed it and show it kindness, and the little will come back several nights later, just like Scratch the dog - and always be around to be petted and played with. Now, you will be able to summon the Owlbear Cub in the final boss fight in Act 3.

The Owlbear Cub is in the Owlbear Nest, the entrance to which is just North of the Bridge West of Silvanus Grove and East of the Blighted Village, where you find the Necromancy of Thay in Baldur's Gate 3, as you can see on the map above. Once you cross the bridge and can see the entrance to the village, turn North into the forest and head down to the riverbank to find the opening to the cave at coordinates X:85, Y:444.
The cave, technically called the Owlbear Nest, is very small - it's basically the Nest itself and a little Baldur's Gate 3 Selune chest puzzle. To find the Owlbear Cub, simply follow the path to the right - though be warned, it's not alone.
SPARE OR KILL THE OWLBEAR

Around the corner you'll go into a dialogue encounter with the Mother Owlbear, assuming it sees you (it won't if you successfully stealth about). If you do get spotted, the Mother Owlbear will make a show of intimidation to get you to back off. Things can go several ways here.

If you pass the dialogue check, you can prevent combat with the Mother and Cub Owlbear. There's several ways to do this - animal handling is the main one, but the Speak with Animals spell can allow you to make a Persuasion or Intimidation check to calm it instead, and Animal Friendship will give you advantage on all these checks. However, they still want you to keep your distance even if you pass the check, so if you get spotted coming too close it automatically goes into combat after and before that interaction. 
If you fail the dialogue check, it goes to combat instantly. Both the Mother Owlbear and Owlbear Cub will attack, though obviously the Mother is the main threat. The combat ends instantly if you kill the Mother, with the Owlbear Cub going non-hostile.
If the Mother ends up dying, the Cub then eats her body, because… well, it's an animal and it's hungry. You'll have an option to put it down there and then if you consider it to be more humane, but you don't have to take it. Obviously, if you want the Owlbear Cub to come back later, you want to let it live.
If the mother survives, she actually dies later anyway, as the local goblins end up hunting her down after she goes on a bit of a killing spree. The Owlbear Cub will end up under their control, until he ends up at your camp looking for comfort.
GETTING THE OWLBEAR CUB IN THE GOBLIN CAMP

At some point later after your first interaction with the Owlbears in their nest, you can find the Cub at the Goblin Camp west of the Blighted Village (it may take a couple of long rests). Here's the way to get it:
Use social manipulation to enter the Goblin Camp as an ally, assuring the guards you're allowed inside.
Immediately look left to find the Goblin Krolla, who runs Chicken-Chasing, and the Owlbear Cub!
Tell Krolla you're leaving and taking the Cub with you.
At this point you can attempt to persuade, intimidate, Illithid-mind-control or just bribe her (500 Gold) into allowing you to take the Cub.
Talk to the Owlbear Cub and let it get your scent, so it can find your own campsite.
Alternatively, killing all the Goblins and their allies in the outside section of the Goblin Camp will allow the Owlbear Cub to escape, but obviously that's a tough challenge. Still, the end result is the same.
As mentioned above, the cub can still join your camp if you kill its mother. Just wait a few days, and the owlbear cub will make its way to camp and stick around if you are nice to it.
FINDING THE OWLBEAR CUB IN YOUR CAMPSITE

At some random point several days later, the Owlbear Cub will appear at the borders of your Campsite, watching wearily. To win it over, do the following:
Pass a DC 10 Animal Handling Check
Choose ""Fetch a Piece of Food From Your Bag"", then ""Toss the Food to the Owlbear"".
At this point the Owlbear Cub will bolt into the forest - but it's clear it'll be back.
After this interaction, the Owlbear Cub will appear periodically and randomly in your campsite in the hope of obtaining more food.
CAN YOU GET THE OWLBEAR AS A COMPANION?

The Owlbear cub is not a summonable companion with the exception of a single encounter at the end of the game that we won't spoil. However, if you have rescued and tamed this beast, you'll be able to talk to it just before the encounter, then summon it at any point during that fight.

Best Ways To Pickpocket And Steal Items In BG3
Getting Caught In The Act
In Baldur's Gate 3, your gear is everything. You could settle for spending top dollar on rare items, but that will quickly wear on your wallet. What if we told you there was a way to set your party up with amazing items without spending a single gold piece? The answer is pickpocketing.
The Best Races For A Rogue In Baldur's Gate 3
Play Video
By entering stealth, you can sneak up behind any unsuspecting shop owner and take whatever you want. However, you have to be careful not to get too greedy or else. Check out this guide to learn all the best ways to pickpocket and steal items in BG3.
Understanding The Basics Of Pickpocketing
How To Get The Loot Without Getting Caught
First of all, you don't have to be a Rogue to do crimes, and even a Fighter in full chain mail can make the attempt (though they will be at a disadvantage). All you have to do is enter sneak mode by pressing C on your keyboard or hold down on the D-pad, and from there, you'll be able to see your victim's sight range.
Stay out of the red zone, because if you walk into it, there's a good chance that you will be caught.
Sneak up close to your victim and click on them to pick their pockets. Choose the item or items you want to steal, and a sleight-of-hand dice roll will occur in the background to determine if you're able to get away with your loot.
The more valuable the item is, the harder the sleight of hand check will be to pass.
Best Ways To Pickpocket And Steal Items In BG3
Using The Right Person For The Job
There are ways to make stealing a bit easier on yourself, and the best way to avoid getting caught is to have Astarion handle the job for you or to take matters into your own hands if you're a Rogue, as they naturally have a higher sleight of hand stat than, say, a wizard or cleric. However, that doesn't mean a cleric can't help you in your thieving efforts, and you can have the healer of the group cast Guidance on your rogue.
If you have a warlock, they can cast Hex on the target to give them a debuff. This will make it easier for the rogue to get away with the goods.
If you don't already have the Smuggler's Ring , now is the time to go get it. It's an item you can find in Act 1 that gives the wearer a bonus to sleight of hand and stealth, and you can get it by looting a skeleton hiding in a bush near The Risen Road part of the map, at the coordinates X:58, Y:512.
After you loot a shopkeeper, get away as fast as you can, because once they realize they've been robbed they will start looking around for the culprit, and it's better to avoid being confronted and not have that awkward conversation. If possible, go after a target who is off by themselves, because trying to pickpocket someone in a big crowd will increase your chances of being seen.
You can lure a target away from a group if you have a cat familiar.
Getting Caught In The Act
Reload Or Talk Your Way Out Of It
Despite your best efforts, sometimes you will get caught in the act, so if you've saved recently you can simply reload and give it another go, but if you haven't, there are a few ways you can handle the situation without reloading. The first is to talk your way out of it with a Persuasion or Deception roll, but the downside is that DC for these checks is oftentimes pretty high, and there's a good chance that you won't be persuasive enough.
You can also attempt to fight out of it, but all the surrounding NPCs will likely jump into the conflict, especially if you're in the middle of a settlement. The last option is to let yourself be carried off to prison, and even though your reputation will suffer slightly, it's not too difficult to break yourself out of jail.
In most cases, you can simply Lockpick the jail door open.

How to pickpocket in Baldur’s Gate 3
Astarion makes a great thief.

If you want to be a devious thief in a fantasy world, you’ll want to pickpocket in Baldur’s Gate 3. The process is quite simple, but do you have the stats to pull it off?

Step-by-step process on how to pickpocket in Baldur’s Gate 3
To start pickpocketing in the game, you’ll need to first crouch. Press the C key on your keyboard for PC or whatever you have sneaking assigned to in your settings. You’ll immediately see the sightlines of nearby characters on the ground. You can’t sneak in red areas. You’ll get spotted, and other characters will be suspicious of you. Try to find someone that is by themselves.
Get close to the character you’re stealing from, and click on them to pickpocket. If an item is red, you’ll get in trouble for stealing it if you’re caught. If the color isn’t present, it’s fair game.
There will be a sleight of hand roll check. Depending on the item, the minimum required number will change. If you’re caught in a town or settlement, you’re arrested for theft. Of course, you can fight off the character to get all their loot, but it can be a bit more civil if you offer a bribe.
Tips for pickpocketing and stealing in BG3
Here are some tips to improve your pickpocketing and stealing skills in BG3.
Get a high sleight-of-hand trait
To improve your pickpocketing in Baldur’s Gate 3, pick a character that has a high sleight-of-hand trait. Astarion is perfect for these situations. In my party, this high-elf Rogue has +11 sleight of hand and +11 stealth. That makes him near-perfect for the job. My wizard, in comparison, only has +1 sleight of hand and +1 stealth.
Use turn-based mode
Did you know the action in Baldur’s Gate 3 doesn’t have to be in real time? You can slow the game down by turning on the turn-based mode. This gives you more time to consider your options for stealth and pickpocketing. However, you can only steal one item per turn, annoyingly. The sightlines are also clearly marked on the floor. Red means that they can see your characters far clearer. If you’re caught, you’ll likely be in a fight.
If you’re on PC, you can head out of the slower-paced turn-based mode by pressing Shift and Space together.
Turn off light sources
At night and in some indoor areas, turning off any light sources like lanterns is a great way to be more effective at pickpocketing in Baldur’s Gate 3. For example, if a brazier is a light source, you can interact with it by clicking the left mouse button. Once the lights are out, your enemies’ sightlines diminish.
Quick save before pickpocketing
If you want a safe and secure way to continue your journey in Baldur’s Gate 3 after pickpocketing, you should use a quick save. Press F5 on your keyboard to perform it and then F8 to quickly load back to the last save you’ve made. It’s that easy!

Pickpocketing in Baldur's Gate 3
The Basics
In Baldur's Gate 3, pickpocketing is a skill that allows players to steal items from NPCs without them noticing. This can be done both in and out of combat. To pickpocket, you first need to Activate sneak mode. It allows your character to move stealthily, making it easier to approach NPCs without being detected.
Ensure you stay out of their red cone of vision.
Pickpocketing
Enter Sneak mode, and approach the target from behind. Then activate the Turn-based mode in the right corner of the screen. This will allow you to better control your actions and stops time for NPCs. You can then scroll through their inventory and decide what you want to take,
After this target the NPC and left-click (or right-click and select the Pickpocket option). Your success depends on your Dexterity, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills.
One of the more confusing things is, how to know if the item is easy or hard to loot. You will need to hover over the item you will see the number - roll target.
So what this means is that you should roll 9 or more to successfully pass this. The higher the requirement, the bigger the risk you take. In this case, I was able to succeed by thin hair:
What if there are multiple NPCs and you cannot become stealthy?
Use Summon Familiar or Minor Illusion to divert enemies' attention or lead them to a more secluded spot, making pickpocketing easier. I only recommend doing this if there are multiple people around
Post-Pickpocketing
NPCs might notice the theft and start investigating. It's crucial to leave the area and wait for the NPC to calm down. This way you can avoid jail or spending gold on briberies. You can make your pickpocket character to either walk away before being found or just go to camp.
However, you must leave one character that has the vision of your target (far away), as otherwise the search animation does not initiate, and your pickpocket will be back before the search has been finished.
If you are caught
Caught in the Act: If you're caught pickpocketing, you can try to talk your way out of the situation. Your success will depend on your character's charisma and persuasion skills. Generally, I found that bribing fails most of the time
Hiding Stolen Items: Transfer stolen items to characters in your group who are away from NPCs. If NPCs decide to check your belongings and don't find the stolen items, they will let you go.
Going to Jail: even if you are caught, going to jail does not bring any huge downsides besides the -5 opinion. You can easily escape the jail by lockpicking or jumping. After that barter some items and give them away for free to get back the opinion
The Pickpocket Build
Early Game Strategy
You can have a good character for pickpocketing just at level 3, with sufficiently high Sleight of Hand bonuses. Of course, it would still work at a lower level, but there are some level 2 spells that greatly improve your chances. My suggestion would be to start with Astarion, who is perfect for the early game. So let's go over how you can improve Sleight of Hand ability checks:
+4 - Proficiency + Expertise in Sleight of Hand. This can be obtained with Rogue at level 1, or Bard at level 3 (they can choose 2 skill expertise)
+3 - 16+ Dexterity. This can be turned into +4 if you reach 18 Dexterity with Ability Improvement feat at level 4.
Halfling Luck - greatly reduces rolling 1s on ability checks
+1 - Gloves of Power, get it at one of the early fights near the Grove entrance.
+2 - Smuggler's Ring obtained when jumping down the Emerald Grove, close to where you encounter Karlach.
+1d4 - Guidance either have someone cast it or use Silver Pendant to learn it.
Advantage - Enhance Ability, learned by Bard, Cleric, Druid, or Sorcerer.
+1 - Vampire Bite with Astarion.
Overall, Astarion makes a perfect pick for this setup, as he starts as Rogue (or respec to Bard once you unlock Withers). Of course, this can also be done with any other character, but Vampire Bite is an excellent early bonus. Now with these things ready here is the further strategy:
Cast Fog Cloud or any other mist-type spell
This is not mandatory to do, but a good way to be unseen in case there are multiple cones of visions in your way. You can use Arrow of Darkness, Fog Cloud, or Darkness to hide yourself inside, and freely pickpocket enemies without detecting you.
Be careful not to cast these on NPCs as they will become aggressive and can attack you.
Reset Vendor Inventories
You can have one character to respec and be level 1. Then, each time you pickpocket the vendor, wait for them to stop searching. After that, level up, change back to a pickpocket character, and continue stealing with full vendor inventory.
I find this a good way to build a war chest early in the game to buy useful items like Elixir of Hill Giant Strength, Hand Crossbow +1, etc.
Optimizing pickpocketing speed
Place one character a bit further away from the trader, but where it can still be seen. Once you finish pickpocketing, exit turn-based mode and teleport to camp. Use the character that you left behind, to see what the trader is doing.
Once the trader is back to their original position, return your thief from the camp and initiate stealing again. This will save a lot of movement from waypoints and steamline the operation.
Maximizing the stealing success chances through the game
As you play, there are a few items and features relevant throughout the acts. Getting these will further improve your chances of obtaining more and more gold, scrolls, and equipment. Let's go through them:
I do recommend getting a Hireling, which would be turned into a ""pickpocket build"". This way you will not need to constantly respec your character or Astarion every time you need some gold.
Act 1
Although I covered most of it, there are a few items to be on the lookout:
Gloves of Thievery - they sound better than they are. Generally, this is an alternative to Enhance Ability, so no problems if you don't get them. Gloves of Power are still your best in slot choice for stealing.
The Graceful Cloth - another item that negates the need for Enhance Ability. However, different from Gloves of Thievery this gives +2 to Dexterity, making an excellent pickpocket option.
Act 2
Here you will also be able to get a few more relevant items
Shapeshifter's Boon Ring - can be looted from Strange Ox. Although you can get it in Act 1, you will then lose out on Hat of Fire Acuity.
If you have the ring have someone cast Disguise Self or use Mask of the Shapeshifter to activate the Shapeshifter's Boon Ring.
Act 3
At level 11, you can hire a Hireling from Withers (if not haven't done so already). Then make it a Rogue to obtain the Reliable Talent, which guarantees a minimum +10 roll. Astarion can still do this as Vampire Bite +1 is very good. However, if he is the main party it would be too tedious to do constant respect - so get a hireling.
Unlucky Thief's Gloves - the best gloves for pickpocketing, that will replace Gloves of Power for +2 instead of +1.
Additional tips
Reset Vendor inventories: you can have one character to respec and be level 1. Then each time you pickpocket the vendor, wait for them to stop searching. After that, level up, change to a pickpocket character, and continue stealing with full vendor inventory.
Optimizing pickpocketing speed: place one character a bit further away from the trader, but where it can still be seen. Once you finish pickpocketing, exit turn-based mode and teleport to camp. Use the character that you left behind, to see what the trader is doing. Once they are back in their original position, return your thief from the camp and initiate stealing again.
Save Often: Before attempting to pickpocket, it's a good idea to save your game. If things go south, you can reload and try again. This is savescumming and it does not work on Honour Mode. However, having a dedicated character for that will not be a huge problem as they can incur all the negative opinion penalties.
Inventory Reset: The merchant's inventories reset every level up, so you can just respec at Withers in camp and get more gold, potions, etc. every time
Halfling Race with Halfling Luck greatly diminshes chances of failing. Even when you roll a low number, with all the bonuses you should be able to succeed. The goal is to minimze that chance of Critical failure.
You can always be caught: this was a bit puzzling for me to understand at first, if I have huge bonuses from Stealth and Sleight of Hand why do sometimes I get caught picking cheap scrolls? The answer is a critical roll where you roll 1. So there is still always a chance to get caught unless you get Reliable Talent with level 11 rogue.

What about Lucky from halfling? Would that largely negate still getting caught on 1 rolls? Largely only due to the non-zero chance of two one rolls.

Option avoiding getting caught.
Degroup theft, as soon object is stolen, send theft to camp. Theft victim will do checks on other team members which u will pass. Afterwards return theft back from camp

Yeah but you can just move those allies further away, and wait till the target walks around, searches, and goes back to original position

Instead of distracting people, I've found that using scroll/arrow of darkness works better. It breaks LoS and you can still pickpocket since it's a melee action, and nobody will see you do it (saves a lot of work. I used to do the illusion/familiar/bard thing in the beginning lol)

This can be risky as Darkness can now be treated as hostile action

Baldur’s Gate 3: How To Rob Everything | Perfect Pickpocket Guide
August 3, 2023
by Kevin Thielenhaus
Pickpocket literally anyone with these thievery tips.
To become the perfect pickpocket in Baldur’s Gate 3, you’ll need some help from your wizard friends. Enemies and friendly NPCs are packed with goodies on their bodies, and you can rob everyone with the Rogue class. Sneaking has been completely overhauled in the new game, and the system is far more robust than it’s ever been in Baldur’s Gate.
When you enter sneak mode in Baldur’s Gate 3, your rogue can pickpocket enemies without being seen. As long as you stay out of the red cone of vision, you can attempt a pickpocket attempt. Stealing is one of the best ways to make tons of cash, and it’s just fun — you can even do it to enemies that are way out of your league with the right gear. Grab everything from friendly NPCs and if they never notice you, you’re free to enjoy your ill-gotten gains.

How To Pickpocket Any NPC
Before becoming a Master Thief, you’ll need to prepare — one of the best ways to prepare is by selecting the right species. Each fantasy race in Character Customization has specific bonuses that can give you an advantage. Here are the best races to play as if you’re looking to become a rogue.
Rogue Class | Best Species
High Elf
Woof Elf
Drow
Lightfoot
Strongheart
Any race can become a thief, but these races have a tiny edge over the rest. Now let’s talk about how to make your rogue into an unstoppable thievery machine.
NOTE: Summon Familiar is a useful spell that can distract enemies to look in whatever direction you want, or lure enemies away to a more secluded location.
How To Pickpocket Everyone
To become a master thief, you’ll need more than just your Rogue — you’ll also need Cleric and a Warlock. This method was shared by u/RobotWarrior433.
NOTE: Don’t forget to Save before attempting to pickpocket.
Cleric casts Guidance on Rogue.
Warlock casts Hex on whoever you’re trying to pickpocket.
Rogue enters Sneak and sneaks up behind the target to pickpocket.
You’ll have much better chances after casting Guidance and Hex. You’ll get a buff, they’ll get a debuff — and your Rogue will have a much higher chance of stealing stuff.
After stealing something from an NPC’s pocket, they’ll (usually) immediately notice and start looking around. Get out of there and wait for the NPC to re-enter their calm state. They’ll begin searching the area after the pickpocket is triggered — but they won’t keep looking forever.

How to save Mayrina in the Ancient Abode in Baldur’s Gate 3
Keep Mayrina from falling to her death in the Ancient Abode

Depending on how you get to Auntie Ethel’s Gnarled Teahouse in Baldurs Gate 3, you might already have the “Save Mayrina” quest — you can bump into her brothers in the swamp. When you get to the Gnarled Teahouse, though, Auntie Ethel reveals her true colors (green) and teleports Mayrina to a stew pot somewhere in her lair, and you’ll pick up the quest if you haven’t.
Once you make it past the Gnarled Door in the Overgrown Tunnel below the teahouse, you’ll (eventually) face off against Auntie Ethel in her hag form. To successfully complete the “Save Mayrina” quest, you’ll have to do something during the fight (and then a little extra after the fight). Our Baldur’s Gate 3 “Save Mayrina” guide will explain how to keep Mayrina from falling to her death and how to complete the quest.
How to beat Auntie Ethel in Baldur’s Gate 3’s Ancient Abode
After passing through the Gnarled Door, jumping through the waterfall, and descending through the Overgrown Tunnel, you’ll come to the Ancient Abode where you’ll face off against Auntie Ethel in all her hag glory.
Image: Larian Studios via Polygon
Mayrina is there, too, in a Gnarled Cage suspended over a deep pit. On her first turn, Auntie Ethel will set the cage on fire, putting a three turn timer on the fight.
There are a couple methods to save Mayrina from the cage. You can either activate the glowing yellow Control Orb on the west side of the pit or put out the fire with a bottle of water or the “Create or Destroy Water” spell.
Image: Larian Studios via Polygon
If you decide to go for the Control Orb, you can either send a character there, use Mage Hand, or even better, hit the orb with a ranged attack. Once the Control Orb button is pressed, you have to finish the fight before the cage breaks and Mayrina falls.
The fastest way to do this is to just Shove Auntie Ethel into the pit. You’ll need a character with decent Strength to do this — and remember that a Barbarian like Karlach has Advantage on those checks while using Rage. You won’t be able to loot her body, but it’s the surest way to make sure the fight doesn’t drag on. Once Auntie Ethel is defeated, the cage will lower and Mayrina will climb out. And then start yelling at you until she runs off.
If you decide to put out the fire with water, Auntie Ethel will teleport Mayrina out of the cage and disguise herself as Mayrina. An easy way to figure out which Mayrina is actually Auntie Ethel in disguise is to examine them and see which one is wet from the water. Start attacking the Mayrina that isn’t wet and continue the fight until she’s defeated.

After the fight, head into the Ancient Workshop on the north side of the Ancient Abode. There are a lot of confusingly named items inside, but you’re looking for the Bitter Divorce wand. If you Examine it in your inventory, you’ll notice it has the name “Connor” — Mayrina’s husband’s name — carved into it.
With the wand in hand (along with anything else not nailed down), head a little farther north to find a teleporting Mushroom Circle. That sends you back aboveground into the Putrid Bog. Just a little northwest of the other end of the circle, you’ll find Mayrina standing next to her husband’s coffin.
Speak with her there, and you’ll have to option to tell her about the wand. Use the wand on the coffin, and you’ll “The Monkey’s Paw” Connor back to “life.” At that point, you can either keep the wand (and zombified Connor), or give the wand to Mayrina. If you hand it over, she’ll take her zombie husband with her to Baldur’s Gate to keep searching for a cure.
For more information on the classes in Baldur’s Gate 3, consult our overviews on the Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard classes. If you’re stumped by the choice, consult our guide on what class to start with.

How to Start Save Mayrina
ADVERTISEMENT
To start Save Mayrina, head west from the Druids’ Grove until you cross the stone bridge, then head south. You’ll come across a trio arguing, an old woman being berated by two men, who claim their sister vanished due to the old lady named Auntie Ethel.
In order to receive this quest, you need to side with the two men, at which point Ethel will reveal that she’s not as kind or helpless as she lets on, and she’ll vanish. A conversation with the two brothers afterwards will explain a bit of the situation, and they’ll resolve to rescue Mayrina from Ethel.
Whether or not you offer to help, the side quest will be added to your quest log at this point. The entry doesn’t direct you exactly where you need to go, but heading southwest will trigger a scene that may allow you to reveal the true nature of this place. If you fail on the roll, attacking some of the strange sheep in the area will also lift the illusion, revealing that Mayrina’s brothers were right to suspect Auntie Ethel.
Auntie Ethel’s Home
Head west once you’re in the swamp to discover a fast travel destination, then a little further west to a large building where Mayrina and Ethel await inside. Despite her demeanor, Ethel isn’t immediately hostile, though she will send Mayrina away.
ADVERTISEMENT
Instead, Ethel attempts to bargain regarding the tadpole in your brain, offering to remove it, though she wants to tamper with one of your eyes in return. She’ll return it, albeit with some unknown added effect, hampering your perception permanently. Even if you agree to the deal, Ethel is unable to remove the parasite, due to a third party tampering with it. She’ll vanish behind her fireplace afterwards, so interact with it and head through to find a secret cave system.
If you decide to attack Ethel, you’ll need to finish her off quickly, or she’ll retreat with Mayrina into the caves under her home. If you succeed, you can check in on Mayrina after, though Ethel may have sent her away before the end of the fight, in which case she’ll be in the caves behind the fireplace. It's important to note that she didn't attempt to bargain for her life when defeated in the house, only in the caves below, so it might be worth it to let her live until later.
The Caves Under the House
ADVERTISEMENT
Once in the caves, Ethel (if she’s still alive) will warn you to leave before teleporting further into her den. In this entry room you’ll see an array of Ethel’s past victims, as well as a quartet of masks on a table.
Wearing these will help when you reach the room with the noxious gas and traps, but you’ll be susceptible to a psychic barrage from Ethel, and if she succeeds she’ll control the character wearing the mask, forcing the rest of your party to fight them. When you reach the end of the first room, your path is blocked by a sentient door, but it's simply an illusion and if you angle the camera around, you can walk through it by clicking on the floor behind it.
There are four mask bearers in the second large room, and if Ethel is still alive they’ll be hostile, so proceed carefully to take them out. Although these rooms seem large, they’re fairly linear, so continue forward and jump through the waterfall to the other side when you reach it. The next room will be full of gas traps, but wearing the mask allows you to see through the illusion. If you have to wear a mask, put it on and rush through the room to safety and immediately take the mask off afterwards.
How to Save Mayrina - Evil Old Woman, Considered Frightful or Ugly
Mayrina will be in a large cage in the center of the next chamber, along with Ethel, if she’s still alive. After some taunting, it’s time to fight her and her illusions.
She’ll summon 3 other copies of herself, but they’ll each fade after receiving any damage. Mayrina’s cage will also be set ablaze, and she’ll die if the cage reaches 0 HP.
ADVERTISEMENT
So, in order to save Mayrina, be sure to send someone over to the control orb on the far side of the room to save her.
Ethel may also attempt to make Mayrina seem like an illusion. If you’re not sure if she’s an illusion, leave her alone or use non-lethal attacks (found in your passive bar), because the quest will end in failure if you kill her, and she cannot be revived.
Sometimes, if Ethel is weak enough, she may try to plead her way out of her dire situation, offering an extra ability point if you allow her to take Mayrina and flee.
ADVERTISEMENT
You can accept or not, although some characters may be able to chase her off and earn both Mayrina’s freedom and the ability point.
Once Auntie Ethel is gone, speak with Mayrina, who, despite everything, is fairly upset about what you’ve done.
The Cost of Love
She wanted to revive her dead husband, and Ethel promised to bring him back in exchange for her unborn child. She’ll storm off upset, but entering Ethel’s chamber allows you to pick up a wand labeled “Bitter Divorce” and show it to Mayrina since her husband’s name is written on it.
Use the circle of mushrooms at the back of the room to teleport out to safety and show Mayrina the wand.
Choice and Consequences: What Should You Do With the Wand
After showing Mayrina the wand, you'll be presented with three different choices:
ADVERTISEMENT
Use the Wand to Revive Connor
If you use the wand, Connor will be revived as a zombie. You can allow Mayrina to take him, and she resolves to find someone to help her in Baldur’s Gate. You can also claim Connor for yourself, using the wand to summon him whenever you need an extra pair of hands for combat.
Use the Wand to Kill Connor
ADVERTISEMENT
If you try to kill Connor, you’ll have to fight him and Mayrina, bringing the quest to a tragic end.
Snap the Wand
If you snap the wand in two, Mayrina will become upset and run off.
Ultimately, though, whatever you decide here, the quest will be complete.

In Baldur's Gate 3, there are plenty of opportunities to play the hero (or be a villain, for that matter.) One early example of this is Mayrina's plight, which players will discover should they travel to the Fetid Bog.
In the first area that players visit in Baldur's Gate 3, there are a ton of secrets to uncover and quests to complete (indeed, this one area made up the entirety of the early access build of the game). This includes the Fetid Bog and Mayrina's quest.
Updated September 6th, 2023: Players that end up skirting close to the Fetid Bog in Baldur's Gate 3 will come across a group looking for someone named Mayrina. If players make their way deeper into the bog itself, they'll find a teahouse and can embark on a journey to save Mayrina from her predicament. Although it sounds simple on paper, saving Mayrina in BG3 is a bit more complicated than simply finding her. To better help players in locating and saving Mayrina in Baldur's Gate 3, the following guide has been updated with a video.
RELATED:
Baldur'S Gate 3: Best Ways To Use Mage Hand
Finding the Fetid Bog
Players wanting to track down Mayrina's quest should first head to the Fetid Bog and meet with her family, who are trying to get her location out of Auntie Ethel. See this guide for information on that dialog and how to find and get across the bog.
Meeting Mayrina
Players will find Mayrina inside the Riverside Teahouse, where Ethel is insisting she eat 'till she bursts. Informing her about the unfortunate death of her family in the Bog will cause her to call off the deal with Ethel, resulting in Ethel teleporting her away. Asking Ethel too many questions about Mayrina will also result in her getting teleported away. Taking Ethel's deal to handle the Illithid Tadpole will also result in Mayrina getting teleported away.
Antagonizing Ethel will trigger a fight with her Redcap allies and cause her to escape through a hidden passage in the fireplace. Players can, after taking out the Redcaps, turn off the fireplace and walk through the back to find their way into her lair. This fight will also be triggered automatically if players discover the secret passage.
Rescuing Mayrina
After entering Ethel's lair, players will need to find a way through the living door blocking the way forward. Wearing one of Ethel's sinister wooden masks can allow someone to see through her illusion here, but this also gives her a chance to take control of whoever wears the mask. A successful wisdom save (aided by being a paladin with ""Oath of the Ancients) will allow them to resist it, but it's still best to remove it after heading through the door. Alternatively, players can threaten or otherwise convince the door to tell them how to pass through it, though this will require a successful persuasion or intimidation check.
After passing through the door, players will quickly arrive in an open area, where they will be attacked by some of Ethel's brainwashed thralls. This is a good time to try out the non-lethal attack since they're not in their right minds, but players should be cautious and avoid removing their masks, since doing so will result in their deaths. Beyond this point is a path leading further into Ethel's lair, protected by clouds of poison. These can be briefly cleared by lighting them on fire, but the flames will make it dangerous to move through the area and the gas will return unless players are able to block the vents. These vents can only be seen with a successful perception check and can be blocked by throwing an item on top of them.
After navigating the area with the gas clouds, players will arrive at the area where Mayrina is being kept and will need to fight off Ethel to get her out of this mess. Fighting Ethel can be incredibly difficult, especially if players attempt to do this at lower levels. She can create illusions that can cast spells independently of her and tend to use Hold Person to immobilize the party. She also uses ray of sickness to dish out damage and debuff the party.
Ethel will start the fight by lighting Mayrina's cage on fire, so players will need to head for the control orb on the far side of the room to lower the cage and let her out before it kills her.
Players can tell the real Ethel from the fakes because only the real Ethel can receive debuffs. Using Witchbolt to tag her is also a good way of keeping track of the real one. She'll try switching with Mayrina at some point too, so players should make sure to mark her before that point to avoid accidentally killing Mayrina. After she gets low on health, she'll attempt to bargain with the party to keep Mayrina in exchange for power. Players can succeed an Intimidation check here to get her to give them the power and Mayrina too. (Players will receive an item that grants a permanent +2 to one stat.) Players could also just kill her now, since she has to be very low on health for this dialog to trigger.
After Freeing Mayrina, players should grab the wand ""Bitter Divorce"" from the next room, and then find Mayrina outside and speak to her near her husband's coffin. Players have the choice of using or destroying the wand, but either way, the quest will now be considered complete and Mayrina will leave for Baldur's Gate. Choosing to use the wand counts as violating the Oath of the Ancients, so Paladins of that Oath should avoid doing so.
Baldur's Gate 3 is available now for PC and Mac, and on September 6th, 2023, for PS5.

Meeting Ethel[edit | edit source]
Auntie Ethel can be first encountered in The Hollow in the Emerald Grove at X: 192 Y: 544. She runs a small shop selling lotions and potions. Ethel notices that the party looks ill, prompting the option to reveal that they were infected with a mindflayer tadpole. Ethel states that she can help, but that she doesn't have supplies at the Grove. She invites the party to visit her in the wetlands.
Ethel can also be first encountered southwest of the Blighted Village at X: 45 Y: 313, just after entering the Sunlit Wetlands. Johl and Demir are accusing Ethel of kidnapping their sister, Mayrina. In the initial confrontation with Auntie Ethel and the brothers, the party can choose to side with Auntie Ethel, the brothers, or refuse to get involved. If the party side with the brothers, Ethel reveals her true nature and departs for her teahouse. If the party side with Ethel, the brothers attack immediately. If the party do not fight with the brothers, they leave for Ethel's teahouse, where the party can later discover their bodies. If the party refuse to involve themselves in the situation, Ethel tells them they were supposed to rush to her defense. She kills the two men with a poison spell, then departs for her teahouse. In both cases where the party side with the brothers or refuse to get involved, Ethel warns them that if they come to her teahouse, they'd best come bearing an apology. If the party side with Auntie Ethel, she asks the party to come to her teahouse so she can thank them properly.
Ethel's teahouse[edit | edit source]
Auntie Ethel's house is at X: -47 Y: 266 in the southwestern area of the Sunlit Wetlands/Putrid Bog. She greets the party and, regardless of if she was told or not, states she's well aware of the tadpole in their heads. In the teahouse, Auntie Ethel berates a young woman for not finishing her pie, who is revealed to be Mayrina. If Ethel is not yet hostile, the party can initiate
 Get Help from Auntie Ethel. Regardless of the conversation choices, Ethel transports Mayrina further into her lair, done with her complaints about being full.
Most actions after this point lead to Ethel revealing her true form and retreating into her hearth. The party can pursue her through the Overgrown Tunnel. If Ethel is not yet hostile, moving close to the hearth causes an automatic Investigation check. On success, an illusory passage is revealed, which the party can walk through to proceed into the tunnels. If the illusion has not yet been broken, entering the tunnel will cause the Sunlit Wetlands to reveal its true form as the Putrid Bog. While pursuing Ethel through her lair, the party cannot return to camp but is able to short rest.
The overgrown tunnel's door is a former victim of Ethel's.
If Ethel is not yet hostile, she appears within the first part of the tunnel to warn the party away. Regardless of the response, she disappears. The first hurdle is a door of vines. Attempting to open the door causes it to telepathically share its story with the party to warn them from proceeding further.
An Arcana check reveals that the door is an illusion and can simply be walked through. Otherwise, persuading the door causes it to share its secrets:
I can see through you. I can just walk right in. (if investigation check passed)
[DARK URGE] [INTIMIDATION] I will kill here today. It can be you, or it can be the hag. (DC 10)
 +1
 +1
 +1
[INTIMIDATION] Open up, or I'll burn you to ashes. (DC 10)
 +1
 +1
 +1
[PERSUASION] If I kill the hag, you'll be free. (DC 10)
[OATH OF VENGEANCE] [PERSUASION] I will strike the hag down with the full force of my fury - I swear it. (DC 10)
[OATH OF DEVOTION] [PERSUASION] If you let me through, I will do all I can to free you from your torment - I swear it. (DC 10)
[OATH OF THE ANCIENTS] [PERSUASION] The hag is perversion of nature, and I am sworn to strike her down - you have nothing to fear from me. (DC 10)
[BERSERKER] [INTIMIDATION] ROAR. (DC 10 )
[BARBARIAN] [INTIMIDATION] Open. Now. (DC 10 )
Through the door are four servants of Ethel's: Mask of Regret, Mask of Servitude, Mask of Terror, and Mask of Vengeance. They become hostile upon detecting the party. They cannot be spared except by avoiding them entirely before defeating Ethel - non-lethal attacks result in them never becoming conscious again.
On the table next to the door are Whispering Masks. If a party member wears it, they must make a Wisdom saving throw every turn. If failed, they become a Hag's Pawn (controlled by Auntie Ethel) and will attack the party; if all party members equip the mask, the Game Over screen appears. The negative effects of this mask can be prevented by casting
 Protection from Evil and Good before equipping the mask. Only one party member needs to successfully wear a mask to let the full party pass through the door. The masks also prevent the hag servants from becoming hostile, but only towards the masked character(s). Any others need to sneak past to avoid confrontation.
Past the Hag Servants is a waterfall and a winding path filled with noxious fumes and explosive traps. The vents can be covered with any item - including the Whispering Masks on the table. Another option is to simply jump over the fumes.
 Enhance Leap and
 Feather Fall are immensely helpful. Once the party reaches the bottom of the path, they'll see Mayrina in a cage, and Ethel. However, it is possible to avoid the fight by staying on the path to the right. The party can enter the last chamber and even leave via the Mushroom Circle (and take a Long Rest outside). After that the party can return, and run up to the cage to trigger the fight with Ethel.
Facing Ethel[edit | edit source]
After making their way through the Overgrown Tunnel, the party will find Mayrina in a burning wooden cage suspended over a pit. If the cage is destroyed by fire or other means, Mayrina will die. The spell
 Create Water or a thrown container of water can put out the fire, as well as a simple
 Ray of Frost cantrip or Arrow of Ice. Ethel will start at full health, regardless of how much damage was done to her upstairs, and will summon illusory copies of herself that have all of her regular spells and abilities, but are destroyed after taking any damage. The real Ethel keeps her place in the initiative order, and may be distinguishable by that. Ethel will also summon the masked victims from the Overgrown Tunnel and set them on the party if they are still alive and conscious.
Ethel may teleport Mayrina out of the cage, then assume her form, attempting to trick the party into killing Mayrina, as there are now two seemingly identical copies. The Mayrina in the previous position of Ethel CAN be the real Mayrina, so use caution. Generally, the most obvious way to determine if the target is Mayrina is by seeing if the character model is visibly pregnant - the real Mayrina has a belly; Ethel's clones do not. Examining the stat blocks also reveals the truth, as Mayrina remains Level 1, while the clone is Level 5 like Ethel herself. The spell also doesn't affect Initiative, so Ethel and Mayrina will retain their positions in the turn queue.
The Mask of Regret is able to be saved.
Once Auntie Ethel is reduced to below 20% of her life and has a turn to act, she offers the party a chance to make a series of persuasion or intimidation checks.
Depending on the results of the skill checks and subsequent decisions, the party can either free Mayrina:
 -5
 +1
 -1
 -1
 +1
No good can come of this. Let Mayrina go.
[CLERIC OF EILISTRAEE] [DROW] In the name of Eilistraee, release the girl and leave this place - never to return.
Let Ethel keep Mayrina in exchange for the Auntie Ethel's Hair, a special single use item that can increase any Ability Score of any character by 1 permanently:
 +5
 -5
 -1
 -5
 -1
Keep the girl. I'll take the power.
[LOLTH-SWORN] Such power will let me better serve the Spider Queen. Give it to me.
[SELADRINE] The human means nothing to me. Give me the power.
Free Mayrina *and* keep the Hag's Hair both.
 +5
 +5
 +5
 +5
[INTIMIDATION] If you want to live, hand over Mayrina and this power. Right now. (DC 20)
[DECEPTION] My reinforcements are nearly here. Give me the girl and the power and they'll spare you. (DC 20)
[BERSERKER] [INTIMIDATION] Girl, power, everything. OR I TURN YOUR SKULL INTO A PISSPOT. (DC 15 )
[BARBARIAN] [INTIMIDATION] I'll have it all. Or I'll just settle for your life. (DC 15 )
[FIGHTER] [INTIMIDATION] I know a beaten opponent when I see one. Give me the power and the girl, and I'll let you live. (DC 15 )
...or simply kill Ethel:
 -5
 +1
 +1
 +5
 +1
 +1
I think a dead hag is the answer here.
Neither. But a hag's head would make an excellent trophy.
[OATH OF THE ANCIENTS] [OATHBREAKER] [GOOD CLERIC] You're a vile, monstrous creature. There is no bargain for you but death.
[OATH OF THE ANCIENTS] There's no choice to make. A corrupting force like you has to be destroyed.
[EVIL CLERIC] I'll bathe in your blood as I offer your death up in prayer.
[DRUID] You're a stain upon this land, but I will cleanse it.
[MONK] You have nothing that could tempt me.
[RANGER] Hags are the scourge of the natural world. I'm going to kill you - as many times as needed.
If a deal is struck with Ethel, she disappears, but all her thralls remain hostile. If Ethel is killed, the thralls are freed, although all but the Mask of Regret are too far gone to truly be saved. Note that the cutscene to trigger Ethel's deal can be missed if she is killed too quickly - when intending to obtain her hair it's necessary to skip turns to give her a chance to speak once she is brought to low HP. Additionally, Ethel will initiate conversation with whoever is closest to her so it may be beneficial to shuffle party members around in preparation for any ability checks the party may want to make in the conversation.
The Acrid Workshop area here has some treasure, some writings that provide more context and background information, and a Mushroom Circle that teleports the party back outside, to the back of the house. Behind the teahouse is the body of Mayrina's husband, Connor Vinderblad at X: -69 Y: 224. The wand Bitter Divorce, found in the Workshop, can be used to raise Connor as a zombie. The party can then choose whether to give the wand to Mayrina to take her ex-husband with her, or keep it for themselves. If kept, it changes to Second Marriage and can be used at any time to summon Connor as a zombie follower.
Quest rewards[edit | edit source]
Auntie Ethel's Hair if a deal is made with Ethel.
Second Marriage if choose to keep the wand.
Staff of Crones
Companion approval[edit | edit source]
On meeting Auntie Ethel and Mayrina's brothers for the first time, on the outskirts of the swamp:
Refuse to aid Mayrina's brothers - ""You're on your own. I have enough problems.""
 -1
 +1
 +1
 +5
Agree to find Mayrina - ""Let me - I'll bring Mayrina home.""
 -1
 -1
 +1
 +1
 +1
[WIZARD, RANGER, or SORCERER] Warn the brothers about the hags, then agree to help find Mayrina - ""Trust a more experienced soul. I'll find your sister.""
 -1
 +1
 +1
 +5
Give Mayrina the Wand. (After using Bitter Divorce to raise Connor from the dead.)
 +1
 +1
Notes[edit | edit source]
Mayrina's brothers can technically be saved by knocking them out with non-lethal attacks. However, this is somewhat glitchy and part of the dialogue states that the brothers are dead.
Using non-lethal damage on the Hag's Pawns will knock them out in order to save one of them. Returning to them after Ethel is dead and they have regained consciousness will reveal that Mask of Regret has regained her sanity even though the others have not. She can later appear as part of
 Help the Hag Survivors in Act Three.
Using non-lethal damage on the Hag will not trigger her surrender cutscene and will instead knock her out, ending the fight.
Using the wand Bitter Divorce to resurrect Connor will cause the Oath of the Ancients Paladin to become an Oath Breaker.
When the fight with the Hag begins, Auntie Ethel will summon the masked pawn enemies if they were not previously killed or knocked unconscious.
It is possible to spawn the Hag without entering combat immediately by
 flying or
 teleporting to the orb, using the orb to lower the cage and releasing Mayrina, and then talking to Mayrina to make the Hag spawn. The party can hide and sneak down the right path and when they get close to the orb jump to it to avoid alerting Ethel as well. Ethel's red cone of sight can be seen whilst hiding even when she herself is invisible; all hiding or invisible creatures in the game have red cones of sight making it very easy to determine their location.

How to Recruit All Companions in Baldur's Gate 3
We've organized our Baldur's Gate 3 companions guide based on when you'll be able to recruit your teammates once the campaign proper has started (i.e. after the prologue aboard the Nautiloid). Having a full party as you go along is a good idea. Not only will you be able to make use of their class features, but you'll also gain more Inspirations in case characters have the relevant backgrounds.
Shadowheart
Race: High Half-Elf
Class: Cleric (Trickery Domain)
Background: Urchin
Shadowheart is probably the first Baldur's Gate 3 companion that you can recruit. She can be freed while you're aboard the Nautiloid. You'll have to grab a key from a corpse in an adjacent room, then use it to open a chest near her pod. The rune here lets you interact with the controls to her pod, but you still need to use Illithid Wisdom.
Shadowheart can be found in three locations once you start the campaign proper:
If you freed her in the Nautiloid, she'll be fairly close to your character at the beach crash site.
If you didn't free her, keep going north along the coast. You'll spot her at the entrance to the Dank Crypt.
Lastly, if you forgot to do either of the two options above, you'll meet her in the Druid Grove.
Shadowheart romance guide - Her heart might be part of the shadow, but you can make her see the light.
Freeing Shadowheart in the Nautiloid means that she'll end up on the beach.
Astarion
Race: High Elf
Class: Rogue
Background: Noble
You'll meet Astarion to the east of the initial crash site (after you eliminate the Intellect Devourers/brain creatures). If you succeed in a Perception check, you'll realize that he's going to waylay your character. You can still convince him to join up.
Astarion will try to put a knife to your throat. Talk about an eventful first meeting.
Gale
Race: Human
Class: Wizard
Background: Sage
Keep going north of the crash site and you'll see the Roadside Cliffs waypoint. You'll meet Gale here.
Gale happily says hello after materializing from a fast travel point.
Lae'zel
Race: Githyanki
Class: Fighter
Background: Soldier
Lae'zel is one of the first Baldur's Gate 3 companions that you'll meet (she joins you before your first battle on the Nautiloid). However, you do need to look for her after the vessel has crashed. Keep going north of where you found Gale, and you'll spot a couple of Tieflings that have this Githyanki warrior imprisoned in a cage.
The Persuasion or Deception replies here will make the Tieflings go away. Make sure the Tieflings have left the area, then use a ranged weapon to shoot the cage and free Lae'zel.
You'll need to free Lae'zel from the Tieflings that have imprisoned her.
Wyll
Race: Human
Class: Warlock
Background: N/A
Wyll can be found in the Druid Grove. He's in the training area helping out some kids.
Wyll is training some kids.
Karlach
Race: Asmodeus Tiefling
Class: Barbarian
Background: N/A
Karlach is in the wilderness area between the Druid Grove and Blighted Village. Go west from the Druid Grove and cross the bridge to the Blighted Village. Instead of entering it, go north until you see a dog named Scratch. Use your jump action to cross to the opposite side of the river. Follow the short eastern path and you'll see a wounded Karlach.
This starts a quest called Hunt the Devil. Karlach is being hunted by a group of Paladins led by Anders. If you side with the Paladins, you'll have to kill this Tiefling Barbarian. If you side with Karlach, then you'll have to eliminate Anders' squad.
Karlach recruitment guide - Here's how you can recruit Karlach for the launch build.
Karlach romance guide - Find the secret to her infernal heath.
Karlach is wounded, but you can help her out.
Halsin
Race: Wood Elf
Class: Druid
Background: N/A
Halsin is the leader of the Druid Grove. In earlier patches, he'll meet up with you in their sacred place. Now, though, you'll first see him as you make your way to the Goblin Camp and Shattered Sanctum. Inside the Shattered Sanctum, keep going to the northeast and enter the door to the Worg Pens. There, you can battle the Goblins to free a bear, who eventually reveals himself as a shapeshifting Halsin.
You can have Halsin tag along, but this will make all the Goblins in the Shattered Sanctum turn hostile. Later, you'll have to protect the Druid Grove from the Goblin attackers.
Halsin recruitment guide - Halsin joins your team once you've completed his tasks.
Halsin romance guide - And, yes, you can even romance him while he's in Bear Form.
You can rescue Halsin from the clutches of the Goblin army.
Minthara
Race: Drow
Class: Paladin
Background: N/A
Minthara is one of the leaders of the Goblin army opposing the Tieflings and Druids. You can talk to her in the Shattered Sanctum (i.e. there's a ladder that leads to her chambers near the door to the Worg Pens and Halsin).
Minthara is planning to raid the Druid Grove. To side with her, you'll need to provide the location via dialogue. This is followed by a battle where you slaughter everyone in the Druid Grove. Do note that this is an ""evil"" action that will make some companions angry. For instance, Halsin won't help you out even if you free him, since you'll end up killing all the Druids and Tieflings. Wyll, meanwhile, won't have anything to do with you due to the atrocities that you've committed.
Minthara romance guide - Minthara can be romanced during the first act.
Conversely, you have to side with Minthara and the Goblins once they raid the Druid Grove.
Minsc and Jaheira
Minsc and Jaheira are Baldur's Gate 3 companions that can eventually join your merry band. They're returning characters from previous games. Minsc is a Human Ranger, and Jaheira is a Half-Elf.
Jaheira recruitment guide - Jaheira can be found in Last Light Inn during Act 2. She won't join you until you're almost done with the chapter.
Minsc recruitment guide - You'll have a run-in with Minsc during Act 3, and you need to make him come to his senses.
In any case, that's all you need to know about all the companions in Baldur's Gate 3. We'll keep you posted in case of major changes, so stay tuned.
We have many more guides to help you through Baldur's Gate 3, including romance options, quest guidance, build suggestions, and more. Find everything in our Baldur's Gate 3 hub.

Follow Baldur's Gate 3
Baldur's Gate 3 companions are recruitable characters who stay at camp until manually added to your party.
While most companions can be selected as your Origin character at the beginning, there are a few who can't. Most companions in Baldur's Gate 3 are also romanceable, but there are a few exceptions here too.
Whether you want to find them for story, combat, or smooching purposes, we've listed the locations of all companions in Baldur's Gate 3 below, including where to find every companion and how to recruit them.

All Baldur's Gate 3 companions
There are 10 companions in Baldur's Gate 3:
Astarion
Gale
Halsin
Jaheira
Karlach
Lae'Zel
Minsc
Minthara
Shadowheart
Wyll
Of the 10, all Origin characters, plus Minthara and Halsin, can be found during Act 1, with Jaheira appearing in Act 2, and Minsc in Act 3. Jaheira and Minsc are the only two companions who aren't romanceable.
Once you've recruited a companion, they will head to your camp if you currently have a full party. To add a companion to your party, you first have to ask the character you want to replace them with to stay at camp. Then talk to the companion you want in your party and ask them to join you.
Image credit: Larian Studios
To romance a companion, you need to gain each character's personal approval and make the correct dialogue choices if you want to experience their full romance subplot.
It's also worth noting that some companions are missable, so if you want a large roster, make sure to recruit them as soon as you can! Although, keep in mind that companions can also die, leave camp, or refuse to join you in the first place if you make certain story decisions, so be very careful with what you say and do throughout your playthroughs.
Where to find Lae'Zel in Baldur's Gate 3
You first meet Lae'Zel on board the Nautiloid near the very beginning, but you're soon separated when the ship crashes.
To find Lae'Zel again after the crash, head just northeast of the Roadside Cliffs waypoint.
Image credit: Eurogamer/Larian Studios
You'll see Lae'Zel in a cage above a couple of Tieflings. You have to either kill the Tieflings or succeed in Intimidating them in order to turn your attention to Lae'Zel. Once the Tieflings are sorted, use a bow or crossbow to shoot the cage and free Lae'Zel. There's a bow on the ground that you can use if you don't currently have one.
Image credit: Eurogamer/Larian Studios
Don't worry if you miss Lae'Zel at this location, as she'll appear again later, further northwest, at the bridge with the Githyanki patrol.
Where to find Shadowheart in Baldur's Gate 3
Shadowheart is also first encountered aboard the Nautiloid, as you're heading to the control room with Lae'Zel.
To free Shadowheart from her pod you have to go into the room just right of where Shadowheart is (not the room with the main quest marker), loot the Eldritch Rune from the corpse at the back of the room, then insert the rune into the console beside Shadowheart's pod.
Image credit: Eurogamer/Larian Studios
Just like Lae'Zel, you're separated from Shadowheart after the crash, but she's almost unmissable, as you can find Shadowheart again a few steps north of the Ravaged Beach crash site where you wake up.
Image credit: Eurogamer/Larian Studios
If Shadowheart disappears from this location before you speak with her, then try looking for her either outside of the Dank Crypt, or at Emerald Grove. If she's not at either of these places, then she'll probably be at the Mountain Pass later in the game.
Where to find Gale in Baldur's Gate 3
Gale is found inside the Roadside Cliffs waypoint in Baldur's Gate 3. Approach the purple swirling 'Ancient Sigil Circle' and touch it to start the process of freeing Gale.
Image credit: Eurogamer/Larian Studios
We used our Cleric background to pass a skill check and free Gale, but you can also use Strength, and most likely other class perks. If your Strength isn't high enough, switch to Lae'Zel and use her to pull Gale out.
We're not aware of any other location where Gale will be if you miss him at Roadside Cliffs, as he seems to stay there until you free him.
Where to find Astarion in Baldur's Gate 3
Astarion is located southwest of the Roadside Cliffs waypoint, just past the inside of the crashed Nautiloid, near the water.
Image credit: Eurogamer/Larian Studios
We know Astarion stays here for quite a while until you talk to him, but we don't know where to find him should he vacate this area - or if he even does.
Where to find Wyll in Baldur's Gate 3
Wyll is inside The Hollow, west of Emerald Grove. If you walk past the merchant at the start of the Hollow, you'll see Wyll training with some Tieflings.
Image credit: Eurogamer/Larian Studios
If you recruit Karlach first, however, Wyll can disappear from this spot. If he does disappear, it's likely that Wyll will automatically appear at your camp when you take a Long Rest - but you might need to sort out The Hollow's Goblin problem first.
Where to find Halsin in Baldur's Gate 3
Halsin is located in the Worg Pen, which is past the door found up the stairs in the northeastern corner of Shattered Sanctum at the Goblin Camp. You have to fight some Goblins in the Worg Pen to free Halsin though, so be prepared before you go through the door.

If you want to continue exploring the Goblin Camp without the rest of the Goblins turning hostile, make sure to tell Halsin to stay in the Worg Pens for now.
Don't worry if you miss Halsin at the Goblin Camp, as he'll appear at Emerald Grove once you complete the Goblin attack storyline anyway.

Halsin is also a rather unique companion, as he doesn't officially join you until Act 2, even though you can speak to him at camp. So, to fully recruit Halsin, you have to go to the Last Light Inn in the Shadow Cursed Lands area, then speak with Jaheira and wake up Art Cullagh. Follow the questline relating to Art and you'll eventually be able to add Halsin to your party, as long as you keep him alive.
Where to find Karlach in Baldur's Gate 3
Karlach is found by a stream south of The Risen Road waypoint and tollhouse containing Paladins. Follow the path littered with corpses and Hyenas, then take the turning down to the stream and you'll spot Karlach at the end of the area.

It's possible that Karlach might disappear from this location if you take too long to find her. If this happens, she might show up when you get to Baldur's Gate, but we haven't been able to confirm this for sure ourselves.

Game Pass Ultimate required.
Also, keep in mind that Karlach will refuse to join your party if you turn on the Tieflings at Hollow Grove. This means that it's hard to recruit Karlach and Minthara in the same playthrough, but ignoring the Goblin attack questline altogether might make it possible.
Where to find Minthara in Baldur's Gate 3
Minthara is one of the most missable companions in Baldur's Gate 3, as she's actually one of your targets if you choose to side with the Tieflings during the Goblin attack storyline in Act 1.
So, if you're planning on doing a 'good' playthrough, you might want to skip recruiting Minthara. Although, it might be possible to recruit Minthara if you skip the Goblin questline altogether and head straight to Moonrise Towers, if you want to keep your morals somewhat intact while recruiting her.
Minthara is first located at the back of Shattered Sanctum, which is the building at the back of the Goblin Camp.

If you want to recruit her while following the Goblin attack storyline, you'll have to tell her Emerald Grove's location and agree to meet her at the camp and deceive the Tieflings.
Talk to Zevlor at the gates of The Hollow and blow the horn to call Minthara. She will appear and tell you to turn on the Tieflings. You must do so at this point if you want to add Minthara as a companion later.

While Minthara won't join your camp straight away, you'll meet her again at Moonrise Towers later in the story. You must rescue Minthara from her trial here in order to fully recruit her as a companion.
Where to find Jaheira in Baldur's Gate 3
Jaheira is first located during Act 2 at the Last Light Inn in the Shadow Cursed Lands area.
To fully recruit her, however, you have to continue all the way to the end of Act 2. She'll then automatically appear at your camp near the end of Act 2, as your party makes its way to another location as part of the story.
Where to find Minsc in Baldur's Gate 3
It takes a while to add him to your party, as Minsc is found during Act 3 of Baldur's Gate 3.
Minsc will be in the Lower City of Baldur's Gate. You have to follow Jaheira's quest and go to the Counting House and speak with one of the bankers to reveal his location. Then, you need to follow the quest further to find him behind a sluice gate in the Sewers. Keep following this questline and ensure Minsc stays alive to eventually recruit him.

Baldur’s Gate 3: How to recruit every companion in BG3
The party members you love, and the ones you completely missed, and how to recruit them all in Baldur's Gate 3
Dave Aubrey | Sep 11, 2023
Baldur’s Gate 3: How to recruit every companion in BG3 /
-00:00
Unless you’re playing with a full team of four friends in co-op, then one of the highlights of Baldur’s Gate 3 will be the cast of companions. Each companion has their own individual storyline – which just might be your highlight of the game – and if you don’t recruit them you just might miss out on it entirely, on top of the companions themselves, each of which could be essential for your team compositions in the future.
You won’t be able to recruit all companions in a single playthrough – the decisions you must make will exclude certain party members from joining you forever – so you need to think pretty hard about which party members you want to hang out with most before you get to that point. Wouldn’t you know it, this list is perfect for just that purpose! Make sure to read through below – and be prepared for some minor spoilers – as we break down how you can recruit every companion in BG3.
How to recruit Astarion – BG3
Larian Studios
Astarion is one of the first potential companions you’ll interact with following the crash of the Nautiloid vessel, and he can be found just North of the beach you land on. Play nice with him, and he’ll join your party. Astarion’s a Rogue and is best played from the shadows to stack Critical Hit bonuses. For more details, check our guide on how to recruit Astarion.
How to recruit Shadowheart – BG3
Larian Studios
Shadowheart is another early addition – to win her favor early, you can be sure to free Shadowheart from the Nautiloid pod. She’ll automatically be friendly with you when you encounter her on the beach near where you wake up. Shadowheart’s a Cleric, so she can learn heals in addition to a few vicious spells. If you like her as much as I do, you’ll want to know how to romance Shadowheart in BG3.
How to recruit Gale – BG3
Larian Studios
Gale is another early companion, and can be found just North of the crash site – quite close to Astarion, actually. You’ll see a magic portal on the wall here, and if you interact with it, you can pull Gale out, having him join your party. Gale’s a Wizard, making him a decent long-range fighter and support character. For specific details, check our guide on how to recruit Gale.
How to recruit Lae’zel – BG3
Larian Studios
You’ll also meet Lae’zel on the Nautiloid, the sharp-tongued Fighter. Lae’zel will attack you and almost always join you in solidarity thanks to your shared condition. After the crash, you can find her in a cage just North of the crash site, captured by two Tieflings. Make sure to save her to get her in your party. As a Fighter Lae’zel will get bonus attacks and access to more Action Points in battle, making her fierce. If you like that in a woman, you might be curious about how to romance Lae’zel.
How to recruit Wyll – BG3
Larian Studios
After escaping the crash site and heading North you’ll come across the Emerald Grove entrance, and a band of goblins are just about to attack. Wyll will be part of the skirmish, on the druid’s side, of course. Following the battle head inside Emerald Grove and you can find Wyll near the training dummies. If you join his quest to hunt the “Hellspawn” you can invite him to your recruit your party. For more details, check our how to recruit Wyll guide.
How to recruit Karlach – BG3
Larian Studios
Karlach is a powerful Barbarian, and she’ll be more than willing to join your party – assuming you haven’t caused any trouble for her fellow Tieflings at the Emerald Grove, that is. Wyll is actually hunting Karlach, but you can convince him to stop. Help Karlach take care of the people pursuing her, and she’ll join your party.
How to recruit Halsin – BG3
Larian Studios
Halsin is a complicated person to actually recruit – he’ll join your camp easily enough, but fighting alongside you in battle is another thing entirely. First you’ll need to save the Emerald Grove by speaking with Nettie, and then meeting with Halsin at the Goblin Camp jail. Free him and defeat the Goblin Leaders in order to have Halsin join camp, at least for now.
Once you reach the Shadow Cursed Lands in Act 2, you can speak with Art Cullagh, who is in a bed, sick, at the Last Light Inn. Pass some checks here to get Art to mention “Thaniel,” whom Halsin is searching for. Report back to Halsin and he’ll ruch to Art’s side, kicking off a chain of quests to save the Shadow Cursed Lands. If you complete them and save Thaniel, Halsin will join your party for the adventures going forward.
How to recruit Minthara – BG3
Larian Studios
Minthara is one of the toughest party members to recruit, because it seems so obviously like the “bad” decision. In fact, it’ll ensure Wyll and Karlach leave your party, and it’ll also make recruiting Halsin impossible.
Not only will you need to give Minthara the location of the Emerald Grove – this must be before Kagha completes the rite – and help her slay the Tieflings and Druids inside, but you’ll also need to follow her orders afterward, being escorted to Moonrise Towers by her goblin troupe.

Once you finally manage to reach Moonrise you’ll need to convince people not to kill her, and getting out alive will be a challenge too. But if all succeeds, she’ll return to your camp with you, where you can finally recruit her. After all of that effort, it’d be a shame not to learn how to romance Minthara, right?
How to recruit Jaheira – BG3
Larian Studios
Jaheira is a classic Baldur’s Gate character, and you’ll meet her leading the defense of the Last Light Inn in Act 2. As long as you’re thorough in completing the quests in this area, and keeping Jaheira herself alive, she’ll offer to aid you in assaulting Moonrise Towers. Before the final encounter with Ketheric Thorm, make sure to tell Jaheira to face the man alongside you. As long as she survives and Thorm meets his end, she’ll be willing to permanently join your party after.
How to recruit Minsc – BG3
Larian Studios
Once you reach Act 3 you’ll hear a lot of chatter about a certain “Stone Lord” taking control of the criminal underworld in that area – spoiler alert, but that Stonelord bloke is actually Minsc, another character that DnD and Baldur’s Gate fans will recognize.
If you take Jaiheira to the Guildhall you’ll learn more about the Nine-Fingers and the Stone Lord, leading to the Aid the Underduke quest. From the Guildhall you’ll learn that the Nine-Fingers plan to ambush the Stone Lord at the Counting House. Talk your way into the vault to find Minsc in there, where he’ll escape into the sewers.
Find him in the sewer and battle him, ensuring that the final blow is dealt with a non-lethal attack. Jaheira will approve of this, and you can get an option to have Minsc join your party as a companion permanently.
