    "## <ins>Guide Selection for SEO Analysis</ins>\n",
    "- To perform a robust SEO analysis, I will focus on specific guides from four major gaming websites ([IGN](https://www.ign.com), [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com), [Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com/), and [GamesRadar+](https://www.gamesradar.com)) that cover the popular game *Baldur's Gate 3*. The selected guides span diverse topics to ensure a comprehensive comparison of SEO strategies, keyword usage, and content structure.\n",
    "---\n",
    "## <ins>Compliance and Ethics</ins>\n",
    "- I ensured the compliance of scraping the selected websites—[IGN](https://www.ign.com), [Polygon](https://www.polygon.com), [Screen Rant](https://screenrant.com), and [GamesRadar+](https://www.gamesradar.com)—by thoroughly reviewing their respective `robots.txt` files. These files define the permissible areas of each site for automated crawling, and I confirmed that the URLs I plan to scrape do not fall under restricted paths or disallowed sections. Adhering to `robots.txt` is essential for respecting the site's terms of use and avoiding unauthorized access to restricted content. This step ensures that my project remains within ethical and legal boundaries while analyzing the selected guides.\n",
